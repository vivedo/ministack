## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **DSQL — the wire proxy forwards query results in batches** — with `DSQL_STRICT=1`, the proxy in front of each cluster's Postgres backend read, re-framed and flushed every backend message separately, so a large result set cost one round of awaits per row and the proxy, not Postgres, set the speed. It now reads the backend socket in 64 KiB chunks and forwards every complete message in a chunk with one write. In a local benchmark against the same `postgres:16-alpine` backend (8 connections), a 5,000-row read went from 6% to about 100% of direct-Postgres throughput and a 100-row read from 8% to 47–69%; transaction-state tracking and the proxy's own probe queries are unchanged.

## [1.5.21] — 2026-10-03

### Added

- **API Gateway v2 — custom domain names and API mappings** — `CreateDomainName`, `GetDomainName`, `GetDomainNames`, `UpdateDomainName`, `DeleteDomainName` and `Create`/`Get`/`Update`/`DeleteApiMapping(s)`, with domain tags through `TagResource`, list pagination, and `BadRequestException` "Invalid stage identifier specified" for a mapping to a missing stage; `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::DomainName` and `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::ApiMapping` in CloudFormation. A domain and its mappings are the same resource as the API Gateway v1 domain and base path mappings, and a request whose `Host` is the domain reaches the mapped HTTP API. Reported by @wparad.
- **CloudFormation — stack updates replace resources** — a change to a property the change set reports as `RequiresRecreation: Always` now creates a new resource under a new generated name, points its dependents at it and deletes the old one after the update succeeds (a rollback deletes the new one instead). With an explicit, unchanged name the update fails with the AWS message naming the physical id; this now also covers `AWS::Lambda::Function`. A named SQS queue or SNS topic fails with AWS's already-exists error instead and keeps its messages or subscriptions. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::EFS::FileSystem`, `AWS::EFS::MountTarget` and `AWS::EFS::AccessPoint`** — the three types create, update in place and are replaced on create-only changes through the EFS store, with `Ref` and `Fn::GetAtt` as in the template reference, so CDK `efs.FileSystem` stacks deploy. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **EFS — file system policy, protection and replication** — `PutFileSystemPolicy`, `DescribeFileSystemPolicy`, `DeleteFileSystemPolicy`, `UpdateFileSystemProtection` and `Create`/`Describe`/`DeleteReplicationConfiguration`; `CreateMountTarget` checks the subnet, security groups, zone and address (`SubnetNotFound`, `SecurityGroupNotFound`, `MountTargetConflict`, `AvailabilityZonesMismatch`, `IpAddressInUse`), and `DeleteFileSystem` with mount targets answers 409. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **Bedrock AgentCore — Memory resources** — `CreateMemory`, `GetMemory`, `ListMemories`, `UpdateMemory` and `DeleteMemory`; memory strategies are recorded without extraction. Contributed by @pingedbrain.
- **Athena — databases, DDL, and Trino-style table references** — `ListDatabases` and `GetDatabase` read the Glue Data Catalog; `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` apply to it, creating the Glue table Athena would (formats, SerDe, TBLPROPERTIES); `CREATE TABLE` without `EXTERNAL` is rejected as Athena rejects it, and Iceberg tables are not supported; a query may name a table as `"awsdatacatalog"."db"."t"` or `db.t`. Contributed by @sjincho.
- **CloudFront — distributions serve traffic, plus the AWS-managed policies and monitoring subscriptions** — a request to `<label>.cloudfront.net` (or `<label>.cloudfront.<MINISTACK_HOST>`) is served: ordered cache behaviors, `ViewerProtocolPolicy`, `AllowedMethods`, `DefaultRootObject`, cache and origin request policy forwarding (and legacy `ForwardedValues`), `viewer-request` / `viewer-response` CloudFront Functions, response headers policies, and S3 or custom origins; an S3 origin is read only as the bucket policy allows it (OAC, OAI or public). `DomainName` has the AWS `d` + 13-character shape. `List*Policies` return the AWS-managed cache, origin request and response headers policies, and `Create`/`Get`/`DeleteMonitoringSubscription` are implemented. Not modelled: caching, WAF, logging, geo restrictions, custom error pages, signed URLs and cookies, Lambda@Edge. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **CloudFormation — EKS cluster and node group updates** — `AWS::EKS::Cluster` applies `Version`, `Logging`, `ResourcesVpcConfig`, `AccessConfig.AuthenticationMode` and `Tags` in place and `AWS::EKS::Nodegroup` applies `ScalingConfig`, `Labels`, `Taints`, `UpdateConfig`, `LaunchTemplate`, `Version`, `ReleaseVersion` and `Tags`, where every such change used to report `UPDATE_COMPLETE` and was dropped. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Pipes::Pipe` and `AWS::Scheduler::ScheduleGroup` update in place** — a pipe keeps its stream position and `CreationTime` when `Description`, `Target`, `RoleArn`, `DesiredState` or `Tags` change, gets `Description` and `Tags` on create and refuses a create-only source change under an explicit `Name`, and a schedule group takes template and stack tag changes while keeping tags added through `TagResource`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — ECR repositories are replaced** — an `EncryptionConfiguration` change on `AWS::ECR::Repository` replaces the repository under a new generated name (generated names now carry the usual suffix) and is refused for an explicit `RepositoryName`, where it used to be ignored. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — IAM roles and managed policies are replaced** — a `Path` change on `AWS::IAM::Role` and a `Path` or `Description` change on `AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy` replace the resource under a new generated name, a named role refuses it as a custom-named replacement, a named policy fails with the IAM duplicate-name error as on AWS, also when only its `Path` changes, generated policy names get the suffix other generated names have, and both ARNs include the `Path`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `IMPORT` change sets execute** — existing SQS queues, SSM parameters, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, IAM roles, log groups, Lambda functions, IoT policies, IoT CA certificates and Cognito user pools are adopted into a new or existing stack without being changed (`IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS` to `IMPORT_COMPLETE`, or a rollback when a resource is gone), and an import that changes `Outputs` or stack tags is refused, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Fixed

- **Docker — the image healthcheck probes `GATEWAY_PORT`** — it always requested `localhost:4566`, so a container started on another port reported `unhealthy` while serving; it now resolves the port as the server does (`GATEWAY_PORT`, then `EDGE_PORT`, then `4566`). Contributed by @skialpine.
- **Lambda — Node.js and Python functions start in the code directory** — `process.cwd()` and `os.getcwd()` were MiniStack's own directory, so libraries that read files relative to it (such as `node-config`) missed the function's files; the working directory is now the code root (`LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`), as on AWS. Contributed by @drakeo338. Reported by @shane-patzlsberger.
- **STS — `AssumeRole` honors trust-policy denies and conditions** — with `AUTH=true`, a matching `Deny` (including `NotAction`) overrides an `Allow`, and `sts:ExternalId` and `sts:RoleSessionName` conditions are evaluated; a denied call returns `AccessDenied` and creates no session. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **Cognito — federated sign-in tokens** — the ID token carries the `nonce` from `/oauth2/authorize`, both tokens carry `cognito:groups`, and a user linked by a PreSignUp trigger signs in as the linked profile instead of a new one. Contributed by @kjdev.
- **CloudFormation — nested stack with a `Transform`** — under `AUTH=true`, a nested stack whose template declares a `Transform` or calls `Fn::Transform` fails with `Requires capabilities : [CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND]` unless the parent acknowledged `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` and `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` update in place** — a stack update re-ran the create, which gave the resource a new endpoint, resource id and create time and emptied the cluster's member list; the properties the create stores now change on the existing record, a create-only or `Engine` change replaces the resource or, under a custom identifier, is refused, a cluster `MasterUsername` change leaves the cluster as it is, change sets report which properties replace, and a stack-created cluster can now be described and answers `Fn::GetAtt DBClusterResourceId`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **SES — a sandboxed account sends only to verified or simulator recipients** — SES v2 `PutAccountDetails` with `ProductionAccessEnabled=false` puts the account (per region) in the sandbox, as on AWS, and `GetAccount` reports it with the submitted `Details`. A sandboxed send to a recipient that is neither a verified address or domain identity nor a `@simulator.amazonses.com` address fails with `MessageRejected` "Email address is not verified. The following identities failed the check in region …" for v1 `SendEmail`, `SendRawEmail` and `SendTemplatedEmail` and v2 `SendEmail`; bulk sends reject only the affected entries. Accounts stay in production by default. Reported by @skialpine.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::ECS::Cluster` and `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition` update in place** — a cluster change keeps the cluster (settings or configuration dropped from the template stay), and a task definition change registers the next revision of the family and deregisters the old one instead of overwriting revision 1. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — more `IMPORT` types** — SNS topics, KMS keys and aliases, IoT thing types, Cognito user pool clients, groups, resource servers and identity pools, and API Gateway REST APIs and stages can be imported, including two-key identifiers, and `Fn::GetAtt` on an identity pool's `Id` resolves. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `ImportExistingResources`** — a `CREATE` or `UPDATE` change set imports an added resource whose static custom name already exists (it needs `DeletionPolicy` `Retain` or `RetainExceptOnCreate`), and a rollback releases imported resources instead of deleting them. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **ECS — `UpdateService` with `forceNewDeployment` replaces the tasks** — it was ignored when the task definition did not change. Rolling deployments now pin image digests from the first task, honor `versionConsistency` `disabled`, use `repositoryCredentials` for private registries, and report `imageDigest` and the Fargate platform version; a task falls back to the local image when the pull fails. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **AutoScaling — target tracking alarms** — `PutScalingPolicy` with `TargetTrackingScaling` creates the `TargetTracking-<group>-AlarmHigh-<uuid>` alarm and, unless `DisableScaleIn` is set, the `AlarmLow` one on the tracked metric, lists them in `Alarms` of `PutScalingPolicy` and `DescribePolicies`, replaces them when the policy is updated and deletes them with the policy or its group. An `AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy` in a template does the same. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT — mTLS trusts every registered device certificate** — the listener no longer fails the TLS handshake for an ACTIVE certificate whose CA was deactivated or deleted before its first connect, or that was registered without a CA; as on AWS, only the certificate's own status refuses it. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway — usage plan throttling** — a REST API request carrying an API key from a usage plan on the stage is throttled with `429 Too Many Requests` by the plan's `throttle` and its per-method `apiStages[].throttle`, in addition to the stage's method settings, and a throttled response carries `x-amzn-ErrorType: TooManyRequestsException`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway — request body validation follows JSON Schema draft 4** — a request validator checks the body against the draft 4 keywords of the model (`enum`, `pattern`, length, range and `multipleOf` bounds, `integer` versus `number` versus `boolean`, `items`, `additionalProperties`, `patternProperties`, `dependencies`, `allOf` / `anyOf` / `oneOf` / `not`, formats, and `$ref` to local definitions and to other models of the API); an empty body and a body nested more than 1000 levels deep are refused, and a schema that applies itself to the same value again answers 500. `BAD_REQUEST_BODY` and `BAD_REQUEST_PARAMETERS` read `{"message": "..."}` and carry `x-amzn-ErrorType: BadRequestException`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway v2 (WebSocket API) — `$connect` authorization** — a `CUSTOM` `$connect` route ran no authorizer. It now runs its REQUEST authorizer, refuses the handshake with 401, 403 or 500 and passes `principalId` and the context to `requestContext.authorizer` of the connection's events. `CreateAuthorizer`, `CreateRoute`, `UpdateRoute` and the CloudFormation resources refuse a JWT authorizer, JWT route authorization and authorization on a route other than `$connect` with `BadRequestException`, as AWS does; a JWT `$connect` route kept in saved state refuses the handshake with 500 instead of validating the token. `requestContext.stage` names the stage in the connection URL instead of `$default`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — Docker executor under `USE_SSL=1` when MiniStack runs in a container** — the gateway certificate, CA bundle and Java truststore were bind-mounted into every Lambda container from MiniStack's own filesystem (`MINISTACK_SSL_CERT`, or the generated `ministack-tls/server.crt` under the temp directory), paths the host Docker daemon cannot see, so every invocation failed with `bind source path does not exist`. In a container they are now copied into the Lambda container, as function code already is. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **RDS — `DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes`** — was unimplemented (`InvalidAction: Unknown RDS action`), so Terraform's `aws_db_cluster_snapshot` resource failed on read (`reading RDS DB Cluster Snapshot … attribute`) after creating the snapshot. Returns the `restore` attribute with no shared accounts (the manual-snapshot default); `ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute` is not implemented. Unknown snapshot ids answer `DBClusterSnapshotNotFoundFault`. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **SES — a send from an unverified sender is rejected** — v1 `SendEmail`, `SendRawEmail`, `SendTemplatedEmail` and `SendBulkTemplatedEmail` and v2 `SendEmail` and `SendBulkEmail` accepted any `Source` / `FromEmailAddress`. AWS requires the sender to be a verified identity in the account and region, in production as well as the sandbox, and now so does MiniStack: the send fails with `MessageRejected` "Email address is not verified. The following identities failed the check in region …". A verified domain covers its addresses and subdomains, domain names compare case-insensitively and email addresses case-sensitively, as AWS documents. Tests that send from an address they never created as an identity need a `VerifyEmailIdentity` / `CreateEmailIdentity` first. Reported by @skialpine.
- **CloudFormation — a change set with only new stack tags lists them** — it ended `FAILED` with "didn't contain changes"; it now lists each resource the stack holds, other than a custom resource or wait condition, as a `Modify` with `Scope: Tags`, and stack tags given in another order are no change for a change set or `UpdateStack`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — change sets list what a change reaches** — a resource that references a replaced resource, an attribute of a modified resource or a changed parameter is now listed as a `Modify` whose detail names the cause (`ChangeSource` `ResourceReference`, `ResourceAttribute` or `ParameterReference`, with `CausingEntity`). Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **ECS — `DescribeClusters` statistics** — `include=["STATISTICS"]` returns the sixteen running/pending task and active/draining service counters per launch type instead of an empty list. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **ECS — `DescribeClusters` honours `include`** — `settings` and `tags` come back empty and `attachments` and `configuration` are left out unless requested, `CreateCluster` keeps `configuration`, and a CloudFormation cluster reports its tags and the default `containerInsights` setting. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::S3::MultiRegionAccessPoint` and `AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration` are replaced on update** — every property of both types is create-only, so a change now creates the resource under a new generated name and deletes the old one after the update (a `Regions` change was dropped and the stack reported the alias as the physical id, a launch configuration was overwritten under its old name), fails with the custom-named-resource error when the name is explicit, and is reported as `Replacement: True` in a change set. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::SQS::Queue` with `FifoQueue` gets a generated `.fifo` name** — `FifoQueue: true` without a `QueueName` creates a FIFO queue with a generated `.fifo` name instead of a standard queue, and a `QueueName` whose `.fifo` suffix disagrees with `FifoQueue` fails the resource. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `Fn::Select` in a condition** — a condition such as `!Not [!Equals [!Select [2, !Ref KeySpec], ""]]` was always true; conditions now resolve `Fn::Select`, and an index outside the list fails with `Template error: Fn::Select cannot select nonexistent value at index N`, in conditions and in properties. Contributed by @mishukdutta-cz.
- **CloudFormation — `Ref` to a list parameter** — a `Ref` to a `CommaDelimitedList` or `List<...>` parameter gave the raw string, so a list property got one item per character; it now gives the space-trimmed list. A list in a nested stack's `Parameters` or in an `AWS::SSM::Parameter` `Value` fails the resource. Contributed by @mishukdutta-cz.

## [1.5.20] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- **DynamoDB — global table replicas through `UpdateTable` `ReplicaUpdates`** — a `Create` was accepted and ignored, so Terraform / OpenTofu `aws_dynamodb_table` with a `replica` block waited forever. A `Create` now copies the table and its items to the other region and turns on `NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES` streams; `DescribeTable` reports `GlobalTableVersion` `2019.11.21` and the other regions under `Replicas` as `ACTIVE`; writes and TTL settings replicate; `Delete` removes the replica. Reported by @wparad.
- **IoT — registry events** — with a type enabled through `UpdateEventConfigurations`, the thing, thing type, thing type association, thing group, thing group hierarchy and thing group membership operations publish the AWS payload to `$aws/events/...`, where MQTT subscribers and topic rules receive it. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **ElastiCache — serverless caches** — `CreateServerlessCache`, `DescribeServerlessCaches`, `ModifyServerlessCache` and `DeleteServerlessCache` for `valkey` (major 7, 8 or 9) and `redis` (major 7). With Docker each cache gets a TLS-only Valkey or Redis container whose certificate chains to the CA at `GET /_ministack/elasticache/ca.pem`. `ModifyServerlessCache` allows a same-engine major upgrade, redis to valkey, and valkey 7 to redis 7. Memcached serverless caches and serverless snapshots are refused with `InvalidParameterValue`. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Lambda::Version` updates `FunctionScalingConfig` in place** — a stack update re-ran the create, which published a new version for every change; a `FunctionScalingConfig` change now keeps the version, also when the update rolls back. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Glue::Database`, `Table`, `Partition`, `Connection`, `Crawler`, `Job` and `Trigger`** — they failed with `Unrecognized resource types`; they now create, update and delete through the Glue API, so Athena and the Glue API read a stack's tables. Ref and `Fn::GetAtt` follow the CloudFormation reference, as do replacing and in-place properties; a `DatabaseInput.Name` change fails with `Database <name> not found` and rolls back, as on AWS. Crawlers and jobs are only recorded, never run. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::ElastiCache::SubnetGroup`, `ParameterGroup`, `CacheCluster`, `ReplicationGroup`, `User` and `UserGroup`** — they failed with `Unrecognized resource types`; they now go through the ElastiCache API, so a stack's cluster or replication group gets a real container-backed endpoint to pass to a Lambda function or ECS task. Replacement follows the CloudFormation reference (including `NumCacheNodes` when no Availability Zone is given), everything else updates in place, and `Fn::GetAtt` on an endpoint the resource does not have fails, as the reference says. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **IoT — `DescribeEventConfigurations` and `UpdateEventConfigurations`** — both answered `Unsupported IoT path`; they now store the registry event switches per account and region, every type starting disabled, an update changing only the types it names, and `creationDate` / `lastModifiedDate` set from the first update on, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::ServiceDiscovery::HttpNamespace`, `PrivateDnsNamespace`, `PublicDnsNamespace`, `Service` and `Instance`** — they failed with `Unrecognized resource types`, which blocked the CDK ECS Cloud Map constructs; they now go through the Cloud Map API, with Ref, `Fn::GetAtt` and replacement as in the CloudFormation reference. Namespaces now store `Properties.DnsProperties.SOA.TTL`, and `DeleteNamespace` removes the namespace's hosted zone, as on AWS. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **Bedrock AgentCore — runtime version history and endpoint pinning** — runtime updates now retain version snapshots, `GetAgentRuntime` retrieves a selected version, and `ListAgentRuntimeVersions` paginates the history. `DEFAULT` advances with the latest version while named endpoints stay pinned until updated; invocations use the selected snapshot, with containers isolated by version. Contributed by @pingedbrain.
- **Bedrock AgentCore — `ListAgentRuntimes` and `ListAgentRuntimeEndpoints` paginate** — both take `maxResults` and `nextToken` and return a `nextToken` only when another page exists. Contributed by @pingedbrain.

### Changed

- **botocore 1.43.106** — the service models MiniStack reads move from 1.43.63 to 1.43.106; the images keep `awscli` 1.45.63, installed on the same botocore instead of its pinned one.

### Fixed


- **SES v2 — `ListEmailIdentities` and `ListConfigurationSets` answer the routes newer SDKs use** — botocore 1.43.106 sends them as `POST /v2/email/list-identities` and `POST /v2/email/list-configuration-sets` with `NextToken`, `PageSize` and `Filter` in the body; those paths answered `NotFoundException`. Both forms page, and the `Filter` keys are applied.
- **Kinesis — `ApproximateArrivalTimestamp` keeps milliseconds** — it was truncated to whole seconds, so an `AT_TIMESTAMP` iterator from an SDK that sends fractional seconds skipped records written earlier in the same second.
- **CloudFormation — an empty `Capabilities` list is accepted** — botocore sends it as a bare `Capabilities=`, which was read as one empty value and refused, so `aws cloudformation deploy` without `--capabilities` and `Capabilities=[]` from an SDK failed with a `ValidationError` since 1.5.11.
- **API Gateway v2 (HTTP API) — the request path keeps a `%25` escape** — `/items/a%252Eb` reached the Lambda's `rawPath` as `/items/a%2Eb`, because the path was fully percent-decoded. The HTTP API path now keeps `%25` and decodes every other escape as before; `rawPath`, `requestContext.http.path`, `pathParameters` and route matching all use it. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **Step Functions — JSONPath `$$.` paths read the context object** — a Choice rule's `Variable` and its variable-to-variable comparison paths (including inside `And`, `Or` and `Not`), and a state's `InputPath`, `OutputPath` and Map `ItemsPath`, resolved `$$.` against the state input, so a Choice on `$$.Execution.Input` silently took its default branch. They now read the context object, as the AWS context object reference lists for those fields. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment` updates in place** — a changed `InternetGatewayId` or `VpnGatewayId` moves the attachment under the same `IGW|vpc-…` / `VGW|vpc-…` physical id, `VpnGatewayId` is attached at all, and a `VpcId` change leaves the gateway attached to the new VPC, or to the old one when the update rolls back. `AttachInternetGateway` on a gateway already attached to a VPC answers `Resource.AlreadyAssociated`, and a stack attaching it to a second VPC leaves it on the first, as AWS does. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Lambda::Version` publishes through `PublishVersion`** — the version takes its `Description`, a version of a function unchanged since its latest version fails with the `AlreadyExists` error AWS reports, `FunctionScalingConfig` on a function without a capacity provider is refused, and a function keeps its `CapacityProviderConfig`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **AppConfig — hosted configuration version numbers are never reused** — a version created after a delete, and the replacement CloudFormation makes for a changed `HostedConfigurationVersion`, get the next unused number instead of overwriting the live one, and a `LatestVersionNumber` mismatch reports the AWS message. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a deleted `AWS::AppConfig::Deployment` stays in `ListDeployments`** — the stack delete removed the deployment, so a replaced deployment left the environment's history and the next one reused its number; it now stays until its environment is deleted, which, through the API or with its stack, also removes its deployments and their tags. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::ECS::Service` stores `NetworkConfiguration` and `LoadBalancers` in the ECS API shape** — `DescribeServices` returns them in camelCase on create and update, and a service from a template registers its tasks in its target groups. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **SESv2 — `CreateEmailIdentity`/`GetEmailIdentity` return Easy DKIM tokens for a DOMAIN identity** — a domain identity created without `DkimSigningAttributes` answered an empty `Tokens` list with `Status: NOT_STARTED`. AWS provides a set of DKIM tokens for its CNAME records in that case (Easy DKIM), so the Terraform `aws_sesv2_email_identity` resource's `dkim_signing_attributes[0].tokens` indexing failed. A DOMAIN identity now gets three tokens, `SigningAttributesOrigin: AWS_SES` and `Status: PENDING`, unless `DkimSigningAttributes` brings its own key (BYODKIM); EMAIL_ADDRESS identities are unchanged. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **Lambda — functions reach a `USE_SSL=1` gateway** — the gateway listener serves only HTTPS, but a function's default `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` was plain HTTP in every executor (Docker, the warm worker and the local subprocess), and the Docker executor's Node shim downgraded a function's `https.request` to the gateway to HTTP, which the listener resets. The default endpoint now follows the gateway's scheme, the shim keeps TLS, and a host process trusts the gateway's certificate through `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` / `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` / `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` unless they are already set. Without `USE_SSL` nothing changes. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **RDS — `MINISTACK_RDS_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=1` works with a Compose `hostname:`** — a containerised MiniStack whose container sets a hostname left instances `creating`, because the self-lookup by `HOSTNAME` found no container. A containerised MiniStack now detects its network as with the setting off (`DOCKER_NETWORK`, then the self-lookup). Contributed by @skialpine.
- **IoT — `DeleteThingGroup` refuses a group with child groups** — the delete went through and left the children pointing at a missing parent; it now fails with `InvalidRequestException` "Cannot delete thing group : {name} when there are still child groups attached to it", and a CloudFormation stack delete that reaches such a group ends in `DELETE_FAILED`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT — `UpdateThing` honours `removeThingType`** — the flag was ignored, so the thing kept its type, and an update without `attributePayload` cleared the attributes. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway v2 (HTTP API) — a doubled leading slash still selects the route** — a request to `//items/abc` matched no route and answered `404 {"message":"Not Found"}`. Route selection and `pathParameters` now ignore the extra leading slashes; `rawPath` keeps the path as received. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **Cloud Map — `DeleteNamespace` refuses a namespace that still has services** — it deleted the namespace (and now its hosted zone) anyway. It answers `400 ResourceInUse` "Namespace has associated services; delete the services before deleting the namespace", as on AWS.
- **Lambda — `PublishVersion` of an unchanged function returns the latest version** — it published a new version every time; AWS doesn't publish when the code and configuration haven't changed since the last version, and returns that version with its original description.
- **API Gateway v2 (HTTP API) — REQUEST authorizer identity sources** — a declared identity source missing from the request answers `401 {"message":"Unauthorized"}` without invoking the authorizer, cached or not (it required caching). `$context.*` sources such as `$context.routeKey` are resolved from the request instead of counting as missing, so an authorizer caching per route no longer answered 401 to every request. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **ECS — optional task-definition fields stay omitted** — registering an EC2 task definition without task-level `cpu`, `memory`, or `requiresCompatibilities` no longer invents `256`, `512`, or `["EC2"]` in register, describe, and deregister responses. Explicitly supplied values remain in the definition. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **IAM — customer-managed permissions use the explicit account** — policy evaluation now resolves the complete policy ARN in the principal's account, so a different ambient request account cannot hide that policy or supply a foreign account's document. Permissions continue to follow the policy's current default version. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **Cognito — `USER_SRP_AUTH` checks the password** — `PASSWORD_VERIFIER` accepted any response, so a wrong password or a disabled or unconfirmed user got tokens. The challenge now carries SRP-6a parameters with a stable salt per user, and a response whose signature does not prove the stored password is refused with `NotAuthorizedException`; `TIMESTAMP` must read `EEE MMM d HH:mm:ss z yyyy`, and a temporary password leads to `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`. `CUSTOM_WITH_SRP` gets the same check. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Cognito — refresh tokens are checked against the pool and client** — `REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` (`InitiateAuth`, `AdminInitiateAuth`) and `GetTokensFromRefreshToken` issued tokens for the first user in the pool when the refresh token was malformed, from another pool or of a deleted user, and accepted a token issued to another client; they now answer `NotAuthorizedException` with the message AWS gives for each case, and the refresh token from a SAML or OIDC federated sign-in now refreshes the federated user's session. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::S3Tables::TableBucket` and `AWS::S3Tables::Table` update in place** — a stack update re-ran the create, which reset the bucket's `createdAt` and rebuilt the table with a new `createdAt` and its initial metadata location, dropping committed metadata; a maintenance setting or tag change now keeps both, and a create-only table change under an unchanged name fails with the conflict AWS reports. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — `DescribeGlobalClusters` lists clusters as `GlobalClusterMember`** — each cluster was a `<GlobalCluster>` element, so SDKs that match the list member name, such as aws-sdk-go-v2, found none. Contributed by @IamYipi.
- **Amazon MQ — `DescribeBrokerInstanceOptions` returns `supportedEngineVersions` as strings** — they were `{"name": ...}` objects, which aws-sdk-go-v2 could not deserialize. Contributed by @IamYipi.
- **EventBridge — `UpdateEventBus` returns the bus** — it answered `EventBusArn` and `LastModifiedTime`, which are not response members, so SDKs returned nothing; it now returns `Arn`, `Name` and the bus's `Description`, `KmsKeyIdentifier`, `DeadLetterConfig` and `LogConfig`. Contributed by @IamYipi.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::CodeBuild::Project` stores `Source`, `Artifacts` and `Environment` under CodeBuild API names** — the template's PascalCase members and `BuildSpec` were stored as written, so `BatchGetProjects` dropped them and a build of a stack's project found no buildspec, image or environment variables. Contributed by @IamYipi.
- **Inspector2 — responses aws-sdk-go-v2 can read** — timestamps are epoch seconds, `ListFilters` returns `criteria`, `ownerId`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt`, `CreateFilter` returns `arn`, and coverage `scanStatus` is `{statusCode, reason}`. Saved state is converted on restore. Contributed by @IamYipi.
- **EventBridge — `PutEvents` refuses `aws.*` sources** — an entry whose `Source` starts with `aws.` fails with `NotAuthorizedForSourceException` (`Not authorized for the source.`) in its result entry and counts in `FailedEntryCount`, while the rest of the batch is delivered, as on AWS. Events published with an `aws.*` source through `PutEvents` to simulate AWS services now get this error. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **SQS — `QueueUrl` matches the gateway's TLS scheme (`USE_SSL=1`)** — `CreateQueue`/`GetQueueUrl`/`ListQueues` always returned `http://` URLs, and the AWS SDK v3 uses the QueueUrl itself as the request endpoint (`useQueueUrlAsEndpoint` defaults true), so a client handed that URL left the TLS-only gateway. The `AWS::SQS::Queue` CloudFormation provisioner built the same hardcoded scheme and now reuses the shared helper. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **API Gateway v2 (HTTP API) — a request no stage or route matches answers AWS's exact 404 body** — an unmatched route answered `{"message": "No route found"}` and an unknown stage `{"message": "Stage '…' not found"}`; both now answer `{"message":"Not Found"}` (compact JSON), as AWS does. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **API Gateway v2 — `apiEndpoint` follows the gateway's TLS scheme** — with `USE_SSL=1` the gateway listener serves only HTTPS, but CreateApi and the `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api` CloudFormation resource always returned an `http://` `apiEndpoint`, which nothing answers. They now return `https://`, or `wss://` for a WebSocket API, as AWS does. Without `USE_SSL` the endpoint keeps `http://`. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **IAM — condition value lists and request-tag key matching** — negated conditions now match only when none of their policy values match, so a `StringNotEquals` deny listing permitted values no longer denies one of those values. Request-tag condition keys match every tag name without regard to case, including names that differ only by case; affirmative conditions match any of those values and negated conditions match none. Comparisons of tag values keep the selected operator's case rules. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **SSM — parameter tag actions authorize the parameter named by `ResourceId`** — with `AUTH=true`, `AddTagsToResource`, `RemoveTagsFromResource`, and `ListTagsForResource` checked `Name` instead, so an exact ARN allow could fail and an exact ARN deny could be missed under a broad allow. Accepted parameter-name and ARN aliases now use the canonical parameter ARN for the IAM check. SSM authorization denials now match AWS's HTTP 400 JSON 1.1 response, including the canonical resource and explicit-deny reason. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **Bedrock AgentCore — a missing runtime answers AWS's message** — the control-plane runtime operations answered `Agent runtime <id> not found`; they now answer `ResourceNotFoundException` "Agent '<id>' was not found. Please check the agent ID and try again.", as AWS does.

## [1.5.19] — 2026-09-30

### Added


- **RDS — IAM database authentication for MySQL and Aurora MySQL** — users created `IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin AS 'RDS'` log in with an SDK-generated token over `mysql_clear_password`, as on AWS. The instance or cluster must have `IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled`; with `AUTH=true` the token and the `rds-db:connect` policy are verified too. `ModifyDBInstance` accepts `EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication`. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Kinesis — `SubscribeToShard`** — enhanced fan-out: a registered consumer receives the shard's records as `SubscribeToShardEvent`s over an event stream (HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2) for up to 5 minutes, from any `StartingPosition`, with `ContinuationSequenceNumber` for resuming and `ChildShards` when the shard is split or merged. A second call for the same consumer and shard within 5 seconds is a `ResourceInUseException`; a later one takes the subscription over.
- **CloudWatch Logs — resource policies** — `PutResourcePolicy`, `DescribeResourcePolicies` and `DeleteResourcePolicy`, account-scoped (up to 10) or scoped to one log group through `resourceArn`, with `expectedRevisionId` checks. `AWS::Logs::ResourcePolicy` stacks now create real policies. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **CloudFormation — `RollbackStack`** — rolls a stack left `CREATE_FAILED` or `UPDATE_FAILED` with rollback disabled back to its last stable state: a failed create ends `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`, a failed update reverts its changes, deletes what it added and ends `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`. `RetainExceptOnCreate` is honoured. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **CloudFormation — stack drift detection** — `DetectStackDrift`, `DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus`, `DetectStackResourceDrift` and `DescribeStackResourceDrifts` compare the properties a template sets, plus stack-level tags, with the service's current record (`IN_SYNC`, `MODIFIED` with `PropertyDifferences`, `DELETED`); stacks and resources report `DriftInformation`. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **Bedrock AgentCore — resource-based policies** — `PutResourcePolicy`, `GetResourcePolicy` and `DeleteResourcePolicy` persist policies for runtimes and endpoints. With `AUTH=true`, runtime invocation evaluates caller principals, explicit denies and the runtime-plus-endpoint policy requirement for cross-account calls. This emulates the documented AgentCore policy contract locally; it does not validate behavior against AWS. Contributed by @pingedbrain.
- **KMS — grants** — `CreateGrant`, `RevokeGrant` and `RetireGrant`; `ListGrants` now returns the grants they create, filtered by `GrantId` / `GranteePrincipal` and paged with `Limit` / `Marker`. `CreateGrant` follows the key state, rejects operations the key type cannot perform, and is idempotent for a named grant. Grants persist with the key and are not evaluated for authorization. Contributed by @DaviReisVieira.
- **RDS — IAM database authentication for MySQL and Aurora MySQL** — users created `IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin AS 'RDS'` log in with an SDK-generated token over `mysql_clear_password`, as on AWS. The instance or cluster must have `IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled`; with `AUTH=true` the token and the `rds-db:connect` policy are verified too. `ModifyDBInstance` accepts `EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication`. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed

- **Bedrock AgentCore — runtime and endpoint ARNs match AWS** — `CreateAgentRuntime` returned `…:agent/{uuid}:{version}` and endpoints `…:agentEndpoint/{uuid}`, so identity and resource policies written for AWS never matched and every update changed the runtime ARN. Runtimes are now `…:runtime/{agentRuntimeId}`, stable across updates, endpoints are `…:runtime/{agentRuntimeId}/runtime-endpoint/{name}`, and the `DEFAULT` endpoint is created with the runtime and follows its latest version. Saved state moves to the new ARNs on restore.
- **Bedrock AgentCore — `InvokeAgentRuntime` enforces IAM policies** — with `AUTH=true`, a runtime invocation resolves to `bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime` and is authorized against both the runtime ARN and its runtime-endpoint ARN (the `qualifier`, or `DEFAULT`), as AWS requires, so a policy can allow one runtime and deny another. Before, the action was not extracted and the invocation skipped policy evaluation. Contributed by @pingedbrain.
- **IAM — a negated condition operator is true when its key is absent** — the evaluator treated an absent key as a failed condition for every operator, so a `Deny` guarded by `StringNotEquals`, `StringNotLike`, `ArnNotLike`, `NotIpAddress` or another negated operator never applied to a request without that key. AWS evaluates such a condition as true and denies. The single-valued negated operators now do the same, while `ForAnyValue` and the affirmative operators still fail on an absent key. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Secrets Manager — `BatchGetSecretValue` returns only the secrets the caller may read** — under `AUTH=true` a grant on `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue` alone returned every secret in the request, and `Filters` were ignored, so a filtered call returned the whole store. Each secret now needs `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` and lands in `Errors` as `AccessDeniedException` without it, a call by `Filters` also needs `secretsmanager:ListSecrets`, and the filters select the secrets as in `ListSecrets`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — change set members follow the action** — `Add` and `Remove` changes carried `Replacement: False`, a `Remove` had no physical id, `PolicyAction` was never sent and a `Metadata` or policy detail had no `RequiresRecreation`. `Remove` and `Modify` now name the physical resource, a `Remove` answers `PolicyAction: Delete` and a replacing `Modify` `ReplaceAndDelete` unless the resource retains or snapshots, and attribute details answer `Never`. `PolicyAction` also reports `Retain`, `Snapshot` and their `ReplaceAnd` forms from the resource's policy. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::SQS::Queue` applies every queue property** — `RedrivePolicy`, `RedriveAllowPolicy`, `KmsMasterKeyId`, `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`, `SqsManagedSseEnabled`, `DeduplicationScope` and `FifoThroughputLimit` were dropped on create and update, so a dead-letter queue declared in a template never received messages, and a value SQS refuses now fails the resource instead of being stored. A queue from a template also defaults to a 1 MiB `MaximumMessageSize` and SSE-SQS encryption, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — Docker executor honors timeouts above 300 seconds** — pass the configured `Timeout` to AWS RIE through `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_TIMEOUT`, preventing its default 300-second limit from ending longer invocations early. Timeout updates recycle warm containers so the RIE deadline follows the new configuration. Contributed by @gakuto-cw21.
- **CloudFormation — a nested stack's update deletes the resources its template drops** — a resource removed from the child template, or created by a failed child update that was rolled back, stayed in its service and in the nested stack's resource list. A dropped resource with a `Retain` or `Snapshot` `DeletionPolicy` is kept or snapshotted first, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **KMS — `KeyMaterialId`** — `GenerateDataKey`, `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`, `GenerateDataKeyPair`, `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext`, `Decrypt`, `ImportKeyMaterial` and `DeleteImportedKeyMaterial` return the identifier of the key material they used, and `DescribeKey` reports it as `CurrentKeyMaterialId` for symmetric keys. The identifier stays the same until the key material changes. Contributed by @zlberto.
- **Lambda — VPC configuration includes `VpcId`** — `CreateFunction`, `GetFunction`, `GetFunctionConfiguration`, and `UpdateFunctionConfiguration` now report the VPC of the configured subnets. Previously, VPC-attached functions returned only subnet and security group IDs. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **Lambda — a Docker invocation that reaches its timeout fails** — the emulator's plain-text `Task timed out` reply was returned as a successful payload, so Step Functions recorded `TaskSucceeded` and skipped `Catch`. Contributed by @drakeo338. Reported by @gakuto-cw21.
- **RDS — a persisted instance stays reachable after a restart** — when its saved host port was taken, the instance moved to a new port but `Endpoint.Port` kept the old one.
- **RDS — pending boolean modifications read as `true`** — `PendingModifiedValues` wrote Python `True`/`False`, which the SDKs parse as `false`.
- **CloudFormation — `OnFailure` and `OnStackFailure` are honoured** — CreateStack `OnFailure` and CreateChangeSet `OnStackFailure` take `DO_NOTHING`, `ROLLBACK` or `DELETE` (roll back, then delete the stack). `OnFailure` with `DisableRollback`, or `OnStackFailure=DELETE` on a non-`CREATE` change set, is a `ValidationError`. ExecuteChangeSet now honours `DisableRollback=true`. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **CloudFormation — `DeleteStack` `DeletionMode=FORCE_DELETE_STACK`** — on a `DELETE_FAILED` stack, resources that fail to delete and their dependencies are retained as `DELETE_SKIPPED` and the stack reaches `DELETE_COMPLETE`; on any other status it is a `ValidationError`. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **CloudFormation — `GetTemplate` `TemplateStage` and `ChangeSetName`** — `Processed`, now the default, returns the template after its transforms; `Original` returns it as sent. `StagesAvailable` is reported, and `ChangeSetName` returns a change set's template (`ChangeSetNotFound` when unknown). Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **CloudFormation — stack events carry `ClientRequestToken`** — every event of CreateStack, UpdateStack, DeleteStack, ExecuteChangeSet, ContinueUpdateRollback, CancelUpdateStack and RollbackStack carries that call's token. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **RDS — instances become `available` under `MINISTACK_RDS_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=1` in a container** — database containers were left off MiniStack's network, so readiness never connected and the instance stayed `creating`. They now join the network for readiness and internal wiring, and `DescribeDBInstances` / `DescribeDBClusters` still report `{MINISTACK_HOST, host_port}`. Contributed by @skialpine.
- **IoT — `RegisterCACertificate` checks the verification certificate** — `DEFAULT` mode requires a `verificationCertificate` signed by the CA with the registration code as its CN, and `SNI_ONLY` refuses one, each with its own error; `AWS::IoT::CACertificate` fails the same way. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

## [1.5.18] — 2026-09-28

### Added

- **Bedrock AgentCore — `InvokeAgentRuntime` runs the runtime's container** — with Docker available (full image), the runtime's `containerConfiguration.containerUri` image is started, checked on `/ping`, and invocations are forwarded to its `/invocations` on port 8080; container failures answer `RuntimeClientError` (424). The container is removed on update, delete or reset. Without Docker, or for a code artifact, the deterministic echo remains. Contributed by @pingedbrain.
- **CloudWatch Logs — delivery destination policy** — `PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy`, `GetDeliveryDestinationPolicy` and `DeleteDeliveryDestinationPolicy`, so a delivery that needs a destination policy can be created. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **Cognito — OIDC discovery through the real issuer host (`USE_SSL=1`)** — the generated certificate covers `cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com` for every region and Lambda containers resolve those hosts to MiniStack and trust it. With an `/etc/hosts` entry and the certificate trusted, an unmodified client follows the token's `iss` to MiniStack while `iss` stays exactly as AWS issues it. Reported by @epcap90.
- **KMS — `ListGrants`** — it answered `InvalidAction`. It now lists the key's grants (empty, since grants are not modelled) and answers `NotFoundException` for an unknown key. Reported by @DaviReisVieira.
- **S3 — object annotations** — `PutObjectAnnotation`, `GetObjectAnnotation`, `ListObjectAnnotations` and `DeleteObjectAnnotation`: up to 1,000 UTF-8 payloads per object version, carried by `CopyObject` unless the directive is `EXCLUDE`, removed with their version, and announced with `s3:ObjectAnnotation:*` events. Under `AUTH=true`, Object Lock refuses annotation writes with 403 `AccessDenied`. Previously a `PUT ?annotation` replaced the object with the payload. Contributed by @BoLaMN.
- **SNS — `AddPermission` and `RemovePermission`** — they add and remove labelled statements in the topic's `Policy`; a duplicate label answers `InvalidParameter`. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.

### Fixed

- **API Gateway v1 — REQUEST authorizer events carry `requestContext.identity`** — an authorizer reading `sourceIp` or `userAgent` crashed; both are now present, as in the `AWS_PROXY` event. Contributed by @yosriady.
- **DynamoDB — a table ARN is accepted wherever `TableName` is** — item, query, scan, batch, transaction and table operations answered `ValidationException` or `ResourceNotFoundException` for the table's ARN. Batch responses keep the key form the request used. Contributed by @valeryan.
- **Gateway — the soft open-file limit is raised to the hard limit at startup** — a burst of about a thousand client connections exhausted the default 1024 descriptors. Reported by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **KMS — `ListAliases` entries carry `CreationDate` and `LastUpdatedDate`** — both were missing; `UpdateAlias` moves `LastUpdatedDate` and keeps `CreationDate`. Reported by @DaviReisVieira.
- **Lambda — `ReservedConcurrentExecutions` is shared across versions** — `$LATEST` and published versions each counted separately and could exceed the reservation together. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **S3 — event notification records match S3's** — the key is URL-encoded, `versionId` and a growing `sequencer` are set, `eventVersion` is `2.6`, a delete marker is `ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated`, and `DeleteObjects` sends one event per object it removes. Contributed by @BoLaMN.
- **S3 — notification destinations are validated at PUT time** — under `AUTH=true`, `PutBucketNotificationConfiguration` fails with `InvalidArgument` when an SQS/SNS destination's policy does not let S3 publish; cross-account destinations are accepted. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **SQS/SNS — queue and topic policies are enforced under `AUTH=true`** — they were stored but never evaluated. Cross-account calls need an explicit Allow (`AccessDenied` for SQS, `AuthorizationError` for SNS), and S3 and SNS deliveries need the destination policy to allow them. With `AUTH=false` nothing changes. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **STS — `GetCallerIdentity` resolves IAM-user callers** — keys from `CreateAccessKey` reported `root`; they now return the user's ARN and ID. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **STS — an unknown access key answers `InvalidClientTokenId`** — under `AUTH=true`, STS answered `UnrecognizedClientException`.

## [1.5.17] — 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Lambda MicroVMs — images build and run in Docker** — with Docker available, `CreateMicrovmImage` / `UpdateMicrovmImage` build the `codeArtifact` Dockerfile (`CREATING` → `CREATED` / `CREATE_FAILED`), call the `/ready` and `/validate` hooks, and `RunMicrovm` runs the image. Only the disk is snapshotted. Contributed by @edersonbrilhante.
- **CloudFront — public keys and key groups** — `CreatePublicKey`, `GetPublicKey`, `GetPublicKeyConfig`, `UpdatePublicKey`, `DeletePublicKey`, `ListPublicKeys` and the same six for key groups, with `PublicKeyInUse` / `ResourceInUse` on delete. Contributed by @fabio-andre-rodrigues.
- **Step Functions — execution history pagination** — `GetExecutionHistory` pages with `nextToken`, and `includeExecutionData=false` drops input and output. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **CloudFormation — more types update in place** — AppConfig, AppSync GraphQL APIs and API keys, Auto Scaling groups, policies and scheduled actions, VPCs, subnets, security groups, launch templates, internet gateways, route tables and routes keep their id on a No interruption change instead of being recreated. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Fixed

- **CloudFormation — import change sets are validated and refused** — `IMPORT` change sets are validated and listed as `Import` changes; executing one is refused. Every change carries `Type: Resource`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **SSM — `GetParameter` reads `name:version` and `name:label`** — they answered `ParameterNotFound`; a missing version or label is `ParameterVersionNotFound`. Reported by @lobodpav.
- **Lambda — `ReservedConcurrentExecutions=0` throttles every invoke** — zero was treated as unset. Contributed by @AdrianAcala.
- **Step Functions — Secrets Manager `SecretBinary`** — the SDK integration passes literal text instead of base64. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **Auto Scaling — scaling policies and scheduled actions keep their members** — target tracking, step and predictive settings, `StartTime`, `EndTime` and `TimeZone` were dropped. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **EC2 — subnets, launch templates and route tables answer their attributes** — subnet DNS and IPv6 attributes, launch template `tagSet` and newest-first versions, and every route destination and target. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a failed update rolls back its in-place changes** — changed resources are reverted, and a failed revert lands in `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — ECS cluster settings and stack tags** — `ClusterSettings`, `DefaultCapacityProviderStrategy` and `Configuration` read back, and EC2 network resources carry the stack's tags. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

## [1.5.16] — 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Organizations — member accounts, service control policies and attachments** — `CreateAccount`, `DescribeCreateAccountStatus`, `MoveAccount`, `CloseAccount`, `CreatePolicy`, `DescribePolicy`, `UpdatePolicy`, `DeletePolicy`, `ListPolicies`, `AttachPolicy`, `DetachPolicy`, `ListPoliciesForTarget`, `ListTargetsForPolicy`, `EnablePolicyType` and `DisablePolicyType`, so `aws_organizations_account`, `aws_organizations_policy` and `aws_organizations_policy_attachment` apply. `CreateAccount` answers with a `CreateAccountStatus` whose id the provider reads back through `DescribeCreateAccountStatus`, as on AWS. A root carries `SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY` enabled and the AWS-managed `p-FullAWSAccess`, attaching a policy whose type the root has disabled is `PolicyTypeNotEnabledException`, and deleting an attached policy is `PolicyInUseException`. Reported by @rv0lt.
- **SNS — direct-to-phone publishes can be read back** — a `Publish` with a `PhoneNumber` and no `TopicArn` is recorded and served at `GET /_ministack/sns/sms-messages`, filterable by `account`, `region` and `phoneNumber`. Contributed by @himangshuj.
- **Lambda MicroVMs — image lifecycle** — `ListMicrovmImages`, `GetMicrovmImage`, `GetMicrovmImageVersion` and `UpdateMicrovmImage`. Contributed by @edersonbrilhante.

### Fixed

- **S3 — a versioned object keeps its history across a restart** — with `S3_PERSIST=1` a delete marker was lost on restart, so a deleted object came back. Every version and delete marker now persists with the object on disk, each version keeps its own bytes, tags and ACL, and object tags and ACLs survive a restart for unversioned objects too. Contributed by @pauloRohling.
- **ECS — service deployments track task health and roll back** — a completed deployment drains the previous task definition's tasks, `deploymentCircuitBreaker` fails a deployment whose tasks keep stopping and, with `rollback`, restores the previous one, and replacement stays within `maximumPercent` while keeping `minimumHealthyPercent` of `desiredCount` running. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **CloudFormation — change sets report which property edits replace a resource** — every property edit answered `Replacement: Conditional` and `RequiresRecreation: Conditionally`. For 21 resource types a create-only property is now `Always` with `Replacement: True`, a conditionally create-only one stays `Conditionally`, and every other property is `Never`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **EC2 — Elastic IP tags and IPv6 network ACL entries survive a read** — `DescribeAddresses` omitted EIP tags, so Terraform repeatedly planned `tags` and `tags_all`; network ACL entries always stored and returned an IPv4 CIDR, so an IPv6 rule was read back as a changed IPv4 rule on every plan. Tags and `Ipv6CidrBlock` now round-trip through the EC2 API, and `ReleaseAddress` drops the address's tags. Contributed by @edersonbrilhante.
- **Bedrock — a proxied tool-call turn reports its real token usage** — with `MINISTACK_BEDROCK_PROXY_URL` set, `Converse` and `ConverseStream` estimated usage from the reply text, so a turn that returned only a `toolUse` block reported `outputTokens: 0`, and `inputTokens` ignored the `toolConfig`. Usage now comes from the proxy's own `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens`, with the estimate kept for a proxy that sends none. Reported by @Vidminas.

### Internal

- **CI — one Docker preview comment per PR** — the preview-image workflow updates a single comment instead of posting one per push. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **Tests** — split test files folded into their service's file.

## [1.5.15] — 2026-09-22

### Added

- **ECS — `awslogs` container output reaches CloudWatch Logs** — a task definition's `awslogs` configuration was stored and ignored, so a Docker-backed `RunTask` container's output went nowhere. Lines now reach the configured group, on a stream named `<prefix>/<container>/<task-id>` or after the container id without a prefix, in `awslogs-region`. Contributed by @rszabo50.
- **RDS — an internal broker answers IAM database authentication** — `POST /_ministack/rds/iam-auth` verifies a token against a process-local capability bound to one endpoint, so the MySQL plugin can decide a login. Capabilities are never persisted or issued over HTTP, and nothing calls the endpoint yet. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed

- **KMS — imported key material for HMAC and asymmetric keys** — `CreateKey` with `Origin=EXTERNAL` refused every spec but `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, where AWS supports imported material for symmetric encryption, HMAC and asymmetric keys, ML-DSA excepted. HMAC material is the raw bytes of the spec's length and asymmetric material is the private key alone, DER-encoded PKCS#8, from which the public key is derived; material that does not match the key's `KeySpec` answers `IncorrectKeyMaterialException`, and `GetPublicKey` on a key still awaiting material answers `KMSInvalidStateException`. Reported by @guymahieu.
- **RDS — the server certificate carries the endpoint AWS puts in it** — certificate generation raised `ValueError` once an endpoint passed the X.509 64-byte common-name bound, so a database with a long identifier could not start. The common name is now the advertised endpoint at its full length, the subject carries `OU=RDS, O=Amazon.com, L=Seattle, ST=Washington, C=US`, and the signing CA is named `Amazon RDS <region> Root CA RSA2048 G1`, matching a certificate captured from a real instance. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **API Gateway — an OpenAPI body's `securityDefinitions` reach the methods** — the import discarded security outright, so a SAM API declaring a Cognito authorizer created none and every method imported as `authorizationType: NONE`, serving anonymous callers where AWS answers 401. Each scheme carrying `x-amazon-apigateway-authorizer` now becomes an authorizer, and an operation's `security` — or the document's — sets the method's `authorizationType`, `authorizerId` and `authorizationScopes`, so the enforcement added in 1.5.10 engages for body-defined APIs. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::ApiGateway::Stage` method settings reach the stage as a map** — the template's `MethodSettings` list was stored verbatim, so the throttling lookup added in 1.5.14 raised on it and every request to a CloudFormation- or SAM-deployed API answered 500. The list is now keyed `"<resourcePath>/<httpMethod>"`, `"*/*"` for the stage-wide entry, over the account-level defaults AWS reports from `GetStage`. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **DynamoDB — a table restored outside the current scope keeps working** — startup restore walked the account-scoped store through `values()`, which filters to the request's scope, so another tenant's tables kept the plain dict JSON returns and their first `UpdateItem` raised `KeyError`. Contributed by @ihmpavel.
- **Lambda MicroVMs — requests reach the MicroVM surface** — the AWS CLI signs `/2025-09-09/microvms` and `/2025-09-09/microvm-images` with credential scope `lambda`, so Lambda's function router read the versioned path as a function name. The path now selects MicroVMs first. Contributed by @edersonbrilhante.
- **IoT — the mTLS broker certificate is issued for the endpoint it serves** — its common name was `Ministack IoT Broker` and its SANs covered only `localhost` and the host's addresses, so a client verifying the ATS endpoint hostname refused the handshake. It now carries `*.iot.<region>.<host>` as common name and first SAN.

### Internal

- **CI — control-plane and data-plane tests run in separate lanes** — live-container tests shared the lane with everything else, so a Docker failure looked like a service failure. They now carry a `data_plane` marker and run on their own isolated network, while the control-plane lane runs with no daemon reachable. No user-visible behavior changes. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **Contributor guidance** — `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the three test lanes and the commands that select them, and a new `AGENTS.md` points AI coding agents at the repository layout and the expectations before a behavior change. Contributed by @jgrumboe.

## [1.5.14] — 2026-09-20

### Added

- **KMS — imported key material** — a key created with `Origin=EXTERNAL` stayed unusable because there was no way to supply its material. `GetParametersForImport`, `ImportKeyMaterial` and `DeleteImportedKeyMaterial` now complete the flow: the key waits in `PendingImport`, all five wrapping algorithms unwrap, and `ExpirationModel` and `ValidTo` are reported on the key. Reported by @guymahieu.
- **API Gateway — REST request validators, API keys, throttling and quotas are enforced** — the five `RequestValidator` operations are implemented, a method's `requestValidatorId` is applied to the body and parameters, and an API key is checked against its usage plan's rate, burst and quota. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — update handlers for twelve more types** — a stack update of these types re-ran the create, so the resource came back under a new id or the change was lost. Each now updates in place where its reference allows, replaces otherwise, and refuses to replace a custom-named resource. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — resource-bound IAM database authentication** — a verified token is now authorized against the policy's resource, so a grant scoped to one database user stops matching another. Contributed by @Areson.
- **RDS — PostgreSQL instances serve TLS** — a generated CA signs a server certificate for each container, so a client connecting with `sslmode=verify-full` completes the handshake instead of failing. `GET /_ministack/rds/ca.pem` returns that CA, the local stand-in for AWS's certificate bundle. Reported by @jayjanssen.
- **Bedrock Agent Runtime — `Retrieve` applies `vectorSearchConfiguration.filter`** — the filter was parsed and ignored, so every query returned the whole knowledge base. All eleven comparators plus `andAll` and `orAll` now select against the document's metadata, read from its `.metadata.json` sidecar. Reported by @Vidminas.
- **Bedrock Runtime — `toolConfig` reaches the backing model** — a `Converse` call carrying tools was proxied without them, so the model could never answer with a tool use. Tools are forwarded, and a tool call comes back as a `toolUse` block, streamed as `contentBlockStart` when the caller streams. Reported by @Vidminas.
- **IoT — a job execution times out** — `timeoutConfig.inProgressTimeoutInMinutes` and the device's own `stepTimeoutInMinutes` were stored and ignored, so an execution stayed `IN_PROGRESS` for ever. An execution past its timeout is now `TIMED_OUT`, and the device plane reports `approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut` while it runs.
- **Health — the IoT mTLS listener is reported** — `/_ministack/health` carries `iot_mtls`, and `/_ministack/ready` waits for that listener, so a consumer polling readiness no longer races the MQTT port.

### Changed

- **IAM — wildcard matching is case-sensitive where AWS makes it case-sensitive** — `Resource`, `NotResource`, `StringLike`, `StringNotLike`, `ArnEquals` and `ArnLike` compared case-insensitively, so a policy naming `arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket` also matched `mybucket`. Only `Action` stays case-insensitive, as on AWS.
- **SQS — the default `MaximumMessageSize` is 1 MiB** — queues were created with AWS's old 256 KiB default, so a message between 256 KiB and 1 MiB was rejected where AWS accepts it. The bound accepted by `SetQueueAttributes` moves with it.

### Removed

- **Four timing environment variables** — `TRANSCRIBE_JOB_RUN_SECONDS`, `GLUE_CRAWLER_RUN_SECONDS`, `MINISTACK_DDB_IMPORT_COMPLETE_AFTER_SEC` and `LAMBDA_STATE_TRANSITION_SECONDS` paced emulator-only state transitions and had no AWS counterpart. The transitions keep their previous default pacing.

### Fixed

- **EventBridge — dynamic HTTP parameters for API destinations** — `HttpParameters` JSON paths went to the endpoint as literal `$.` strings. They now resolve against the original event, before input transformation, array indexes and wildcards included. Contributed by @dmgarland.
- **RDS — restarting a cluster keeps its DNS endpoint** — a restart reported the container's IP in place of the `*.rds.amazonaws.com` name handed out at creation, breaking connection strings and hostname-verified TLS. The restart now reports the registered network alias, and the reader endpoint derives its `cluster-ro-` name only when that name was registered. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **RDS Data — a PostgreSQL `SELECT` reports the rows it returned** — `numberOfRecordsUpdated` carried the row count for a read, where AWS reports `0` and leaves the rows in `records`. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **IoT — the registered-certificate event comes from the device connect** — `RegisterCertificate` published it, and an mTLS connect with an unknown certificate got CONNACK 5 with nothing created. AWS creates the certificate `PENDING_ACTIVATION` on the connect, publishes the event with `sourceIp`, and closes without a CONNACK. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT — `DescribeEndpoint` refuses the retired `iot:Data` and `iot:Jobs` types** — both returned a hostname, so a client could keep using an endpoint type AWS no longer serves. AWS answers `InvalidRequestException` 400 and points to `iot:Data-ATS`; both types now get the same errors and messages. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Data — HTTPS `Publish` refuses the topics AWS refuses** — any `$` topic was accepted, so a caller could forge `$aws/events/...` lifecycle events. Reserved topics now answer `InvalidRequestException` 400 "Topic can't start with $", and the MQTT-only jobs, Device Defender and commands topics "Invalid publish to restricted topic using HTTP". Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::ECR::Repository` keeps what the template declares** — scanning and encryption read back empty, lifecycle and repository policies and tags were dropped, `PutImage` failed, and a delete left images behind. The resource now goes through the ECR store. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a rolled-back replacement keeps the old resource** — the predecessor was deleted as soon as the replacement existed, so a later failure rolled back to a resource that was gone. It is now deleted after the update succeeds, and a rollback deletes only the replacement. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway — REST API gateway responses reach the data plane** — a customized response was stored and never applied, so a 401 or 403 carried none of the CORS headers a CDK stack declares. Gateway errors now resolve their type, then `DEFAULT_4XX`/`DEFAULT_5XX`, then the built-in default, with header mappings and `x-amzn-ErrorType`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway — REST API gateway errors answer with the AWS status and message** — invented statuses and exception text went out. A failed authorizer is `500` `AUTHORIZER_FAILURE` with a null message, a missing backend `500` `API_CONFIGURATION_ERROR` `Internal server error`, and an unknown stage `403` `Forbidden`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway — a MOCK integration honours its `statusCode`** — the `200` integration response was used whatever the request template set, so a MOCK method modelling an error returned `200`. The template's `statusCode` now selects the integration response by `selectionPattern`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **AppConfig — `GetLatestConfiguration` serves a feature-flag profile in retrieval-time format** — the stored `{flags, values, version}` document was returned verbatim, so a client reading a flag found nothing at the top level. A `AWS.AppConfig.FeatureFlags` profile is now flattened to its `values`, disabled flags included. Reported by @dk-tanio.
- **Bedrock AgentCore — timestamps are ISO 8601 strings everywhere** — `CreateAgentRuntime` answered with a JSON number while `ListAgentRuntimes` answered with a string for the same field, so a typed SDK failed on one of the two. Both now match the model's `iso8601` format. Reported by @ykalemi.
- **S3 — an omitted notification configuration `Id` is generated** — a configuration sent without one read back without one, where AWS assigns base64 of a UUID. Reported by @jin-gizmo.
- **S3 — a notification configuration is stored in the form the wire uses** — the request XML was echoed back, so a configuration sent with `LambdaFunctionConfigurations` read back empty for a client expecting the wire name `CloudFunctionConfiguration`, which also hid a CloudFormation-declared Lambda notification. Reported by @jin-gizmo.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::WAFv2::WebACL` returns the `Ref` AWS returns** — the bare id came back where AWS returns `name|id|scope`, so a template passing the `Ref` to another resource passed an unusable value.
- **Cognito — the OIDC discovery document follows the gateway's scheme** — every endpoint in it was `http` even with `USE_SSL=1`, so the document contradicted its own `https` issuer and a discovery client refused it. Reported by @epcap90.
- **IoT — rule SQL accepts the grammar AWS accepts** — `!=` and `==` were evaluated, where AWS refuses both, and a nested `SELECT` in a `WHERE` clause was accepted, where AWS answers `Unexpected token, 'SELECT'`. `clientid()` now resolves to `n/a` for a publish that did not arrive over MQTT rather than dropping the field from the projection.
- **IoT — the rule error action document matches AWS** — a failure was reported as `{action, errorMessage}`, where AWS names `failedAction` (`DynamoDBv2Action`, `SnsAction`) and `failedResource` (the table, topic, queue or function the action targeted). `clientId` is `N/A` for a non-MQTT publish rather than empty, and the document carries `sourceIp`.
- **IoT — `CreateJob` validates what AWS validates** — a `schedulingConfig` time with seconds or a `Z`, an `inProgressTimeoutInMinutes` outside 1 to 10080, a document over 32768 characters, a `documentSource` outside 1 to 1350, and a request naming neither a document nor a source were all accepted. Each now answers `InvalidRequestException` with AWS's own sentence.
- **IoT — `DescribeJob` echoes the members it accepted** — `abortConfig`, `timeoutConfig`, `schedulingConfig`, `jobExecutionsRetryConfig`, `namespaceId`, `jobTemplateArn`, `documentParameters` and `destinationPackageVersions` were stored and never reported, and `isConcurrent` and `forceCanceled` were missing. Job timestamps are whole epoch seconds, not fractions.
- **IoT Jobs data — two device-plane answers match AWS** — `UpdateJobExecution` with a status a device cannot set answered `InvalidRequestException` 400 instead of `InvalidStateTransitionException` 409, and an `executionNumber` naming an execution that does not exist was ignored instead of answering `ResourceNotFoundException` 404.
- **Auto Scaling — a duplicate group or launch configuration returns `AlreadyExists`** — the wire code was `AlreadyExistsFault`, the shape name rather than the code, so an SDK caught nothing.
- **CloudFormation — `ExecuteChangeSet` returns `InvalidChangeSetStatus`** — the shape name `InvalidChangeSetStatusException` went out as the error code.
- **CloudFormation — the Rules section refuses `Fn::If`** — it was evaluated because the reference lists it, while a real account answers `Following functions are not supported in the Rules block of the template: [Fn::If]`.
- **CloudFormation — the 60 dynamic references per template quota is enforced** — a template over the limit was provisioned instead of being refused.
- **Lambda — an AWS-published extension layer resolves** — a template referencing `LambdaInsightsExtension`, the Parameters and Secrets, AppConfig or OpenTelemetry extensions or `AWSSDKPandas` could not deploy, because the publisher account is unknown offline. It now resolves by layer name with `CodeSize` 0, so the extension does not run.
- **EC2 — a bare `-e NAME` docker flag takes the host value** — it was passed through as an empty string, where docker either forwards the host's value or omits the variable.
- **S3 Control — an unknown `/v20180820` path answers `InvalidURI`** — it fell through to a generic answer instead of AWS's 400 inside an `<ErrorResponse>` echoing the bad segment.
- **Signer — the `clientRequestToken` replay cache is bounded** — every distinct token was kept for ever and persisted with the service state.
- **CloudFormation — `DeletionPolicy: Snapshot` takes a snapshot** — the policy was read and never acted on, so a resource declaring it was deleted with nothing kept, and an RDS cluster or standalone instance, which AWS defaults to `Snapshot`, defaulted to `Delete` here. Both now snapshot the resource and then delete it, on a stack delete and on an update that removes it from the template.

## [1.5.13] — 2026-09-17

### Added
- **CloudFormation — the `AWS::LanguageExtensions` transform** — a template declaring it was provisioned unexpanded, so an `Fn::ForEach` left the stack in `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` for good and an `Fn::ToJsonString` reached SSM as a Python dict. The transform now runs between `AWS::Include` and SAM: `Fn::ForEach` over literal, `CommaDelimitedList` and intrinsic collections, nested and inside `Properties`, plus `Fn::Length` and `Fn::ToJsonString`. Where the identifier is substituted, the error sentences and the unexpanded `GetTemplateSummary` follow measurements on a real account. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — IAM database authentication tokens are verified** — a helper validates an SDK-generated token against the endpoint, port, database username, signing scope, lifetime and signature. Nothing calls it yet; database login itself is a later stage. Contributed by @Areson.

### Changed
- **Persistence — every saved snapshot is restored through the registry** — a service restored its own state as a side effect of being imported, so the boot path carried a hand-maintained list of eager imports to cover the modules the router never reached. The registry now drives one restore loop, and the runtime work a restore implies runs from each module's `load_persisted_state` instead of its import. No user-visible change. Contributed by @jgrumboe.

### Fixed
- **Router — the first request to any service no longer loads CloudFormation** — the WaitCondition signal handler imported `cloudformation.wait_conditions` above the path check, so every first request pulled in the whole package and, through its provisioners, AppSync and graphql; the first `/_ministack/reset` ran `appsync.reset()` with it. The import now sits behind the path match, and a guard keeps it there. Reported by @ThailerL.
- **DynamoDB — `ImportTable` reads the S3 source** — the import created the table, reported `COMPLETED` and imported nothing: the source objects were never opened. CSV and `DYNAMODB_JSON`, GZIP or uncompressed, are now read from the prefix and written into the table, with the counters reported as it runs and per-item errors in the `/aws-dynamodb/imports` log group. A missing bucket or prefix fails the import and leaves no table behind; `ION` and `ZSTD` are refused with a stated reason. Contributed by @gakuto-cw21.
- **IAM — a Secrets Manager request is authorized against the stored secret ARN** — the resource was built from the name in the request, `secret:<name>`, while AWS evaluates the stored ARN with the six random characters minted at `CreateSecret`. The grant shape the CDK writes for a secret looked up by name, `secret:<name>-??????` or `secret:<name>-*`, matched nothing under `AUTH=true`. The resource now comes from the store through the handlers' own lookup; a secret that does not exist keeps the name-derived ARN. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IAM — a group policy document is validated, and an `AWS::IAM::Policy` naming a missing entity fails** — `PutGroupPolicy` stored a malformed document; all three inline handlers now answer `NoSuchEntity` before `MalformedPolicyDocument`. An `AWS::IAM::Policy` skipped a Role, User or Group that was not there and reported `CREATE_COMPLETE`; the resource now fails with `The role with name <name> cannot be found.`, and an update checks names and document before it takes the old policy off. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IAM — three calls are authorized against the action and resource AWS uses** — a Lambda Function URL invoke is checked against its function ARN, alias qualifier included, and supplies `lambda:FunctionUrlAuthType`, so the policy `grantInvokeUrl` writes matches. The WebSocket `@connections` API asks for `execute-api:ManageConnections` instead of `execute-api:Invoke`. `iot-jobs-data` operations are authorized under `iotjobsdata:`, except `StartCommandExecution`, which stays on `iot:`. A policy written for the old action names stops matching, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — a layer shared through `AddLayerVersionPermission` attaches** — every layer ARN from another account was refused before the stored policy was read. Attachment, from the API and from a CloudFormation function, and `GetLayerVersionByArn` now evaluate it for account, root, public and organization grants, and an attached function keeps the content after the grant is revoked or the version is deleted. A foreign layer version that no grant covers stays refused. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

## [1.5.12] — 2026-09-15

### Added
- **EKS — Pod Identity associations** — the five operations did not exist, so a controller that reads pod identity to find its role, the AWS Load Balancer Controller among them, could not run against MiniStack. Create, Describe, List, Update and Delete serve the records, one per namespace and service account. Deleting a cluster removes them with it. Reported by @josephaw1022.
- **EKS — `aws eks update-kubeconfig` works against MiniStack** — k3s could not authenticate the IAM exec token `aws eks get-token` produces, so the only way in was to copy the admin kubeconfig out of the container. MiniStack now answers a TokenReview webhook: `AUTH=false` accepts local bearer tokens, `AUTH=true` verifies the presigned token and then requires a creator or Access Entry grant. The five general-purpose access policies grant their published Kubernetes permissions at cluster or namespace scope. Contributed by @jgrumboe. Reported by @StraggleCraft.

### Changed
- **SES — one v2 implementation, returning the v1 `MessageId` shape** — `ses.py` carried an unreachable copy of the v2 endpoints that had drifted from `ses_v2.py`. The duplicate is gone and every v2 request is served by one implementation, which surfaced a divergence it had hidden: `SendEmail` answered an id prefixed `ministack-`, where the v1 paths return `<uuid>@email.amazonses.com`. Both now return the shared shape. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **Persistence — every service module declares the same state contract** — a module could expose `get_state`, a `restore_state`, both or neither, so persistence was wired per service and nothing could be derived from it. Every module in `ministack/services/` now exposes the same `get_state` / `load_persisted_state` / `reset` trio, stateless ones included, and a registry-driven test refuses a service that does not. Contributed by @jgrumboe.

### Fixed
- **S3 — a notification configuration whose destination does not exist is refused** — the configuration was stored and the failed test delivery swallowed, so a queue or topic that was not there looked like a successful setup and no event ever arrived. AWS verifies an SQS or SNS destination by sending it a test notification and fails the whole PUT when it does not arrive; a missing one is now `InvalidArgument` with nothing stored. Reported by @ortizgui.
- **ECS — a task walks the whole lifecycle** — a Docker-backed task went straight from `PENDING` to `RUNNING` to `STOPPED`, so a consumer waiting on any other state waited forever. It now reports the states AWS documents, in order: `PROVISIONING`, `PENDING`, `ACTIVATING`, then `DEACTIVATING`, `STOPPING`, `DEPROVISIONING` and `STOPPED`. Every starting state counts against a service's desired capacity, while `pendingCount` counts `PENDING` alone as the API model defines it. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **ECS — a task's `version` counts its state changes** — the counter was minted at `1` and never moved, so a consumer could not tell a stale `DescribeTasks` copy from the current one. It now moves on each change the record reports, matching a real Fargate task: `1` at `PROVISIONING` through `6` at `STOPPED`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **ECS — only an `awsvpc` task reports an elastic network interface** — every task got an `ElasticNetworkInterface` attachment once its container was up, whatever its network mode, while the Task reference describes `attachments` as the adapter a task has "if the task uses the `awsvpc` network mode". Other modes now report an empty list, and an `awsvpc` attachment names the subnet the request placed the task in. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **ECS — a task no longer reports `attachmentsStatus`** — the task record carried the member next to its attachment, and there is no such member on the `Task` shape: the API model has it on `Cluster` only. A client reading the raw wire saw an invented field. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **ECS — the task metadata endpoint reports the status the task is in** — `${ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4}` served `DesiredStatus` and `KnownStatus` as the literal `RUNNING`, captured at registration, so a container reading its own metadata was told the task was running while `DescribeTasks` reported otherwise. Both now follow the task record, with `KnownStatus` per container as AWS reports it. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Cognito — a hosted-UI request that invokes a Lambda trigger no longer deadlocks** — `/saml2/idpresponse`, `/oauth2/idpresponse` and `/oauth2/token` ran on the event loop, so a trigger calling back into MiniStack queued behind its own request and timed out as a `400`. All three now run off the loop, and a replayed authorization code gets `invalid_grant` instead of a `500`. Contributed by @kjdev.
- **SQS — every batch action validates the request before its entries** — the ten-entry limit reached `SendMessageBatch` only, and three more request-level errors the model declares on all three batch actions were never raised. `DeleteMessageBatch` and `ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch` now refuse an empty batch, more than ten entries, repeated ids and malformed ids, failing the whole request rather than landing in `Failed`. Contributed by @CaptainAni187.
- **Persistence — the state map is derived from `SERVICE_REGISTRY`** — it was a hand-maintained dict alongside the registry, and `cloudcontrol`, `config`, `cur` and `organizations` were never added to it, so everything they held was dropped on every warm boot. The save map and the reset set now come from the registry, including the modules a service reaches through its own dispatcher, and a test refuses any service that would be saved with no way to restore it. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **IAM — a resource-scoped policy matches, instead of denying** — under `AUTH=true` the resource ARN resolved to `*` for whole families of request, so only `Resource: "*"` matched and everything narrower was denied. IoT jobs, provisioning templates, both IoT data planes, multi-level MQTT topics and API Gateway invokes now resolve to their real ARNs. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::IAM::Policy` is provisioned inline, not as a managed policy** — the document was stored as an account-global managed policy and attached, where CloudFormation embeds it on each Role, User and Group it names. CDK derives `PolicyName` from the construct path, so stacks sharing a path collapsed onto one record and each deploy took the grants from the ones before it. `ListRolePolicies` and `GetAccountAuthorizationDetails` now report it and the IAM evaluator finds it. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — SQS event source batches are dispatched concurrently** — one thread polled every mapping and waited for each invoke, so a slow handler held messages on unrelated queues, and `ScalingConfig.MaximumConcurrency` was stored but ignored. Batches now run off the poll thread, up to `MaximumConcurrency` per mapping, with a FIFO event source held to one at a time so message groups keep their order. Contributed by @ThailerL.

### Internal
- **Test harness — the suite runs on a non-default `GATEWAY_PORT`** — eight tests compared a value a service had built from `GATEWAY_PORT` against a hard-coded `4566`, so the suite passed only on the default port, which is exactly the port a contributor moves off to avoid resetting a shared server. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

## [1.5.11] — 2026-09-13

### Added
- **CloudFormation — `ValidateTemplate` reports capabilities and transforms** — it answered `Description` and `Parameters` only, so a caller checking a template before a deploy could not see that it needs `CAPABILITY_IAM` or that it declares a transform. It now returns `Capabilities`, `CapabilitiesReason` and `DeclaredTransforms`, on the rule `GetTemplateSummary` already used. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a stack and a change set report their capabilities** — `DescribeStacks` and `DescribeChangeSet` left the `Capabilities` member out, so a client could not see what a deploy had acknowledged. A stack reports what its last `CreateStack` or `UpdateStack` acknowledged, a change set what it was created with, and executing one hands its set to the stack. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Changed
- **Lambda — warm local custom runtimes** — `provided.*` bootstraps reuse the subprocess worker pool instead of restarting on every invocation. Each invocation gets its request metadata through the Lambda Runtime API, concurrent calls lease separate workers, and a failed environment is discarded before reuse. Durable `provided.*` invocations keep the one-shot executor, since a bootstrap reads its environment once, at spawn. Contributed by @jayjanssen.

### Fixed
- **S3 — the `s3:TestEvent` no longer reaches Lambda targets** — `PutBucketNotificationConfiguration` fanned the test event out to every destination, but AWS sends it to SQS and SNS only and verifies a Lambda destination through its function permissions. The payload has no `Records` array, so every S3-triggered function raised on it, and the async path then retried it to `MaximumRetryAttempts` and dropped it in the function's DLQ, where an event AWS never sends looked like a lost message. Queue and topic destinations still receive it. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **S3 — a presigned upload is no longer rejected for the checksum in its query string** — current SDKs sign `x-amz-checksum-crc32` into every presigned `PutObject`, computed over the empty body, because whoever holds the URL picks the body later. MiniStack hoisted that parameter into the request headers and verified it against the real body, so a stock `getSignedUrl` upload failed with `400 BadDigest`. The checksum value parameters are no longer hoisted: they still take part in signature verification, so rewriting one is still `403`, and a checksum sent as a real header is verified as before. Contributed by @bognari.
- **S3 — a presigned URL is verified against the credentials that signed it** — the signature was recomputed with the server's own secret, so a URL signed with an IAM user's or an STS session's key verified against the wrong one, and a deactivated key, an expired session or a session token that was never issued were all accepted. The signing key is resolved to its owner and the URL verified with that key's secret, with the exact session token required for temporary credentials: `InvalidAccessKeyId` (403) for an unknown or inactive key, `ExpiredToken` or `InvalidToken` (400) for a bad token. Under `AUTH=true` an HTTP request also resolves its key to the owning account and `GetSessionToken` refuses temporary credentials. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Lambda — an SDK call from a function runs under its execution role** — under `AUTH=true` every runtime received account-root credentials, so a call from a handler bypassed the role the function declares and a policy that should have denied it did nothing. Each invocation now gets temporary credentials for its `Role` on the warm workers, the Docker and provided runtimes and the one-shot executor, and the IAM layer resolves the assumed role's account, a table's index ARNs and projection keys, and an EventBridge `PutEvents` bus. Contributed by @adamkeener.
- **Lambda — a Node custom resource signals its stack in the docker executor** — the response submitters the CDK bundles into its custom-resource handlers build the `ResponseURL` PUT from the URL's hostname and path only and hand it to `https.request`, so under `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker` the callback went out over TLS to port 443, nothing answered, and the resource hung its stack until `ServiceTimeout`. The shim the executor injects now turns https to the gateway hosts, on the https default port or the gateway port, into plain http on the gateway port; any other host or port keeps TLS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — a durable invocation runs on the warm pool** — durable Python and Node.js invocations went to the one-shot executor, because the three `AWS_LAMBDA_DURABLE_*` variables change per call while a pooled worker's environment is fixed at spawn. Each paid a fresh interpreter start inside the function's `Timeout`, whose default is 3 seconds, so on a loaded machine every durable invocation timed out. The values travel beside the payload now, and both bootstraps apply them before the handler runs and drop them when the next invocation is not durable. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — two durable executions of one function no longer share a callback** — the `CallbackId` was the operation id, which the durable SDK derives from the workflow position, so two concurrent executions registered the same id: the second overwrote the first, an answer sent for one completed the other, and the abandoned execution's own callback then answered `CallbackTimeoutException`. The id is unique per execution and stable across replays and restarts. Reported by @Nhollas.
- **ECS — `RunTask` returns before the image is pulled** — the call blocked while Docker pulled the image and started the container. A task is registered and returned immediately, and walks `PENDING` → `ACTIVATING` (the pull, with `pullStartedAt` stamped) → `RUNNING` → `STOPPED`, with a failed start reported as `TaskFailedToStart`. `StopTask` and a reset no longer race the starter, and `pendingCount` and `runningCount` keep counting `PENDING` and `RUNNING` only. Contributed by @po-luka-miletic.
- **Transcribe — `StartTranscriptionJob` returns a job already `IN_PROGRESS`** — the start response reported `QUEUED` with no `StartTime` and the job reached `IN_PROGRESS` only from the background worker, so a caller that reads the status off the response and then waits for the terminal event never saw an in-progress state. Jobs start `IN_PROGRESS` with `StartTime` set, and `TRANSCRIBE_JOB_RUN_SECONDS` covers the whole run. `QUEUED`, which AWS reaches only through `JobExecutionSettings.AllowDeferredExecution` at the concurrent job limit, is not modelled. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **Cognito — `SetIdentityPoolRoles` keeps the role mappings it is given** — the call stored `Roles` only and `GetIdentityPoolRoles` answered a hard-coded `RoleMappings: {}`, so a mapping set through the API or declared on a CloudFormation attachment was accepted and dropped. Both members are stored on the pool and served back; the call sets the whole configuration, so an omitted `RoleMappings` clears what was there. The map is stored as sent and takes no part in credential vending. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway v2 — `UpdateApi` keeps the description and the API key selection expression** — the call applied five members and discarded `Description` and `ApiKeySelectionExpression`, so an update lost what the create had stored. Both are applied now, and a `CorsConfiguration` on the call replaces the stored one; removing one is `DeleteCorsConfiguration`, which `DELETE /v2/apis/{apiId}/cors` serves. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **EC2 — a security group's IPv6 and prefix-list rules survive the read** — `DescribeSecurityGroups` rendered `ipv6Ranges` and `prefixListIds` as empty elements and dropped every range description, so a rule authorized with an IPv6 CIDR or a prefix list was invisible on the next read and Terraform planned the same egress change on every run. All three families are reported, each with its description. Reported by @edersonbrilhante.
- **EC2 — a launch template keeps its metadata options and shutdown behaviour** — `CreateLaunchTemplate` parsed neither `MetadataOptions` nor `InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior`, so both were discarded at creation and every refresh reported them as newly added. The IMDS settings and the shutdown behaviour are stored and reported on the version, with the response-only `State` the API carries. Reported by @edersonbrilhante.
- **SSM — a `SecureString` parameter reports its `KeyId`** — the key was stored and never served: `DescribeParameters` and `GetParameterHistory` left the member out, so a caller read an empty key and updated the parameter on every run. Both report it for `SecureString` parameters, the only ones it applies to, and an empty `KeyId` on the request means the account default. `GetParameter` is unchanged, since its response shape has no such member. Reported by @edersonbrilhante.
- **CloudWatch Logs — a log group reports its class and its KMS key** — `DescribeLogGroups` omitted `logGroupClass` and `kmsKeyId` and `CreateLogGroup` discarded both, so a consumer reading the class back saw an empty value and planned a replacement of a group that had not changed. Both are stored and reported, with the API's default of `STANDARD` and an unknown class refused, and `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` carries `LogGroupClass` and `KmsKeyId` through the stack. Reported by @edersonbrilhante.
- **CloudFormation — `UpdateReplacePolicy: Retain` holds for every handler-side replacement** — 24 update handlers that replace a resource themselves deleted the predecessor inline, so a template that retains it lost the resource while the stack still recorded `DELETE_SKIPPED`; only the handlers on the shared rename helper honoured the policy. Every inline delete goes through one helper that reads the policy the engine publishes, and the three handlers that deleted before creating create first. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a resource inside a nested stack reads its own `UpdateReplacePolicy`** — the nested-stack deploy loop never published the policy, so a child resource's handler saw whatever the parent's loop had left behind: a retained parent kept every child's predecessor, an unretained one deleted a retained child's. Each child resource's policy is now resolved the way the engine resolves it, intrinsics included, and published around that resource's update only. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a nested stack's IAM resources need the parent's capabilities** — the check under `AUTH=true` read the parent template only, so a parent deployed without `--capabilities` provisioned a child full of IAM roles through `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`. The child template is checked against the set the parent acknowledged, and a child's child reads the same set; a missing one fails the nested-stack resource with `Requires capabilities : [CAPABILITY_IAM]` and the parent rolls back. Without `AUTH` nothing changes. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — an unknown `Capabilities` value is refused** — `CreateStack`, `UpdateStack` and `CreateChangeSet` accepted any string, so a typo or another tool's capability was kept without effect and the deploy behaved as if it had been acknowledged. The member is checked against the three documented values, joined with the other request-level problems into one message. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — the SAM transform reads the transforms the response reports** — `ValidateTemplate` normalises the `Transform` section in every form it takes, while the deploy path had its own normalisation that left the macro object (`Transform: {Name: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31}`) unmatched, so such a template was reported as declaring the SAM transform and then deployed untransformed, failing on `AWS::Serverless::Function`. Both read one function now. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — an `AWS::ApiGateway::Method`'s `MethodResponses` and `IntegrationResponses` are provisioned** — the provisioner read the method and integration properties and discarded both response lists, so a REST API deployed from a template lost its mapped response headers. The visible casualty was the CDK's `defaultCorsPreflightOptions`, whose generated `OPTIONS` method returns the `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers through a MOCK integration: the preflight answered without a single CORS header and the browser blocked the request. Both lists are provisioned onto the method now, and a stack update reprovisions them. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **CloudFormation — `Fn::GetAtt` on a user pool client's `ClientSecret` resolves** — the provisioner returned `ClientId` alone, so a template reading `ClientSecret` or `Name` failed with `Requested attribute ClientSecret does not exist in schema` and rolled the stack back, on the create and on the update that follows it. All three attributes the type declares are returned, on both paths; a client created without `GenerateSecret` reads empty. Reported by @JoshuaSmeda.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Cognito::IdentityPoolRoleAttachment` updates in place** — the type had no update handler, so a stack update fell through to the create. `Roles` and `RoleMappings` are re-applied to the pool the attachment sits on and a dropped property reverts to its create default, since `SetIdentityPoolRoles` takes the whole configuration; a changed `IdentityPoolId` replaces, configuring the new pool before clearing the old. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolResourceServer` updates in place, and a move between pools is refused** — the physical id is the `Identifier` alone while the record is keyed by pool and identifier, so a template that repointed `UserPoolId` left two live resource servers vending the same scopes. `Name` and `Scopes` go through `UpdateResourceServer` on the existing server, a changed `Identifier` replaces, and a changed `UserPoolId` gets CloudFormation's refusal to replace a custom-named resource. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy` and `AWS::SNS::TopicPolicy` update in place** — neither had an update handler, so a changed policy fell through to create under a fresh physical id; the engine recorded a replacement and the cleanup delete then stripped the policy the create had just written, leaving the queue or topic with none. Both properties are No interruption, so the resource keeps its id, writes the document on every queue or topic the template names and removes it from one the template dropped. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::SNS::Subscription` updates in place** — a changed `FilterPolicy` or `RawMessageDelivery` re-subscribed under a fresh `SubscriptionArn`, so `Ref` moved on every update. The No-interruption attributes go through `SetSubscriptionAttributes` on the existing subscription and a dropped one reverts to the create default, while `TopicArn`, `Protocol` and `Endpoint` replace. The create also stores `DeliveryPolicy`, `RedrivePolicy` and `SubscriptionRoleArn`, which it dropped. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Lambda::Alias` updates in place, and `ProvisionedConcurrencyConfig` reaches the service** — the create ignored `ProvisionedConcurrencyConfig` and stored `RoutingConfig` in the template's list shape, on which boto3's `GetAlias` fails. The No-interruption properties go through `UpdateAlias` and the provisioned-concurrency put and delete on the existing alias, `Name` or `FunctionName` replaces, and the routing weights are stored as the `{version: weight}` map `GetAlias` returns. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter` updates in place, and a group change moves it** — a changed `LogGroupName` fell through to create, which wrote the filter on the new group under its unchanged name, so the engine saw no replacement and the old group kept its copy. The No-interruption properties go through `PutSubscriptionFilter` on the existing filter, and a changed `FilterName` or `LogGroupName` creates the new filter before removing the old. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile` updates in place, and a named profile refuses a `Path` change** — a `Roles` change fell through to create, which rebuilt the record without its tags and stored whole role records, on which `GetInstanceProfile` answered 500. `Roles` is applied to the existing record, which keeps its ARN, id and tags; `InstanceProfileName` and `Path` replace, so a custom-named profile whose `Path` changes fails the update as CloudFormation fails it. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — the four HTTP API types update in place** — `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api`, `Integration`, `Route` and `Stage` had create handlers only, so a stack update minted a new id for each: the API re-created every child under a new `ApiId` and `ApiEndpoint` (and rolled the stack back when the id was pinned with `ms-custom-id`), an integration or route left its predecessor on the API while `Ref` moved, and a stage lost its `CreatedDate` and its tags. Each now updates through the service's own call and keeps its id, a dropped property reverts to the create's default, and only `ProtocolType`, `ApiId` or `StageName` replaces. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution` updates in place, and a provisioned distribution is readable** — a stack update minted a new `Id` and `DomainName` and the engine deleted the old distribution, though both of the type's properties are No interruption; and the create stored an empty configuration, so `GetDistribution` and `GetDistributionConfig` answered 500 on every CloudFormation distribution. The create renders the template's `DistributionConfig` into the API's shape, and the update keeps `Id`, `ARN`, `DomainName` and the invalidation history, rolls the `ETag` and reconciles tags, as `UpdateDistribution` does. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — the five CloudFront policy, OAC and function types update in place** — `CachePolicy`, `OriginRequestPolicy`, `ResponseHeadersPolicy`, `OriginAccessControl` and `Function` had create handlers only, so an update fell through to a create that found the record it had made before and returned it untouched: the stack reported `UPDATE_COMPLETE` while the service kept serving the old configuration. Each updates its record now, keeping the id a distribution `Ref`s, and a rename onto a taken name is refused. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

## [1.5.10] — 2026-09-10

### Added
- **Amazon Location — trackers and device positions** — the service did not exist, so a client bound to it failed at the first call and a template with `AWS::Location::Tracker` did not deploy. `CreateTracker`, `DescribeTracker`, `UpdateTracker`, `ListTrackers` and `DeleteTracker` manage trackers, `BatchUpdateDevicePosition`, `GetDevicePosition`, `BatchGetDevicePosition` and `GetDevicePositionHistory` serve positions, and `PositionFiltering` applies (`TimeBased` stores one sample per 30 seconds per device, `DistanceBased` ignores a move under 30 m). Positions are held in memory, newest 100 per device, rather than for the service's 30 days. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **AWS Signer — `StartSigningJob` with its S3 side effect** — the `signer` API did not exist. `StartSigningJob`, `DescribeSigningJob`, `ListSigningJobs`, `PutSigningProfile` and `GetSigningProfile` are served natively; signing is synchronous and synthetic, so the marker object lands at `prefix + jobId` before the call returns and a caller whose contract is the signed object never polls. A missing source object, destination bucket or profile is `ResourceNotFoundException` with no job recorded. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Wireless — `GetPositionEstimate`** — the service was absent, so a client bound to it failed at the first call. `POST /position-estimate` now answers the way the API is shaped: the output structure declares a `payload` blob, so the body is the raw GeoJSON `Point` rather than a JSON envelope. The estimate resolves from `Ip` and is deterministic; `WiFiAccessPoints`, `CellTowers` and `Gnss` are accepted and not resolved. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Amazon Translate — batch text translation jobs** — the service did not exist. `StartTextTranslationJob`, `DescribeTextTranslationJob`, `ListTextTranslationJobs` and `StopTextTranslationJob` run a job against the local S3 store, with the documented filters and paging. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **Lambda Core — network connectors** — Terraform's `aws_lambdacore_network_connector` failed with `Function not found: /2026-04-04/network-connectors`: the service signs with Lambda's own credential scope, so the request reached the function router and the path was read as a function name. `CreateNetworkConnector`, `GetNetworkConnector`, `UpdateNetworkConnector`, `DeleteNetworkConnector` and `ListNetworkConnectors` now serve that path, with `ClientToken` idempotency and `Marker`/`MaxItems` paging. There is no VPC attachment behind a connector; it reaches `ACTIVE` on the next read. Reported by @edersonbrilhante.
- **CloudFormation — the `Rules` section is evaluated** — a template's rules were ignored; they now run after the parameters resolve and before any resource is touched, on `CreateStack`, `UpdateStack` and `CreateChangeSet`. A false `Assert` refuses the operation with its `AssertDescription` as a `ValidationError`, so the CDK's `CheckBootstrapVersion` rule refuses an outdated bootstrap instead of passing silently. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — the `AWS::Include` transform** — an embedded `Fn::Transform` naming `AWS::Include` was carried into the stack as a literal key; it is now replaced by the contents of the S3 object its `Location` points to before the template is validated, and a location that is not an `s3://` URI, a missing object or a nested include is refused before a stack exists. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Changed
- **API Gateway — a REST method's `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizer is enforced** — the v1 data plane matched only `NONE`, `AWS_IAM` and `CUSTOM` and passed everything else through, so a method fronted by a user-pool authorizer served every caller and `requestContext.authorizer.claims` was never populated, leaving a handler that branches on claims to take its no-claims path locally while AWS denied the request. The token named by the authorizer's `identitySource` is now verified against the pools in `providerARNs` and its claims reach the backend; a method carrying `authorizationScopes` requires one of them and answers `403` otherwise. `PutMethod` also stops discarding `authorizationScopes`. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **CloudFormation — the template and stack quotas are enforced** — a template of any size, with any number of resources, parameters, outputs or mappings, and a stack name of any shape were accepted, so a template a real account refuses deployed. The body, resource, parameter, output and mapping limits and the stack-name pattern are now checked before a stack record exists, with the messages the API's parameter validation gives; `ValidateTemplate` also takes `TemplateURL`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `Capabilities` are enforced under `AUTH=true`** — `CreateStack`, `UpdateStack` and `CreateChangeSet` accepted a template with IAM resources or a `Transform` whatever the request acknowledged, so a deploy CloudFormation refuses went through. With `AUTH=true` they now answer `InsufficientCapabilitiesException` and create nothing. Without `AUTH` nothing changes. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Fixed
- **EC2 — `AvailabilityZoneId` is populated on subnets** — `DescribeSubnets` and `CreateSubnet` always returned `null`, even though `DescribeAvailabilityZones` reported the correct mapping, and a consumer that recomputes the id when it is missing (the AWS Load Balancer Controller) can crash on that fallback. The id is now derived from the zone on every creation path, subnets restored from older state are backfilled, and the two members always name the same zone. Contributed by @Alexis-DevOps.
- **EC2 — `DescribeAvailabilityZones` reports `ZoneType`** — the field was omitted entirely, so a consumer that branches on it read it as empty and refused to classify the subnet, blocking Service and Ingress reconciliation. Every zone now reports `availability-zone`. Contributed by @Alexis-DevOps.
- **EC2 — `CreateFleet` applies a launch template's instance tags** — instances created by a fleet came back with an empty `Tags` list even though the referenced launch template carried `TagSpecifications`, which is the mechanism AWS documents for tagging fleet instances. The template's `instance` tags now reach the instances, with a request-level tag winning on a duplicate key. Reported by @edersonbrilhante.
- **Step Functions — numeric `*Path` Choice comparisons** — `NumericLessThanPath`, `NumericGreaterThanPath`, `NumericLessThanEqualsPath` and `NumericGreaterThanEqualsPath` silently evaluated false, so a batch loop guarded by one never exited and eventually failed in `States.ArrayGetItem`. The four operators now resolve the right operand from the input and compare it. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **SES — `SendBulkEmail` is routed** — `POST /v2/email/outbound-bulk-emails` reached no handler, so the call failed instead of sending. It now routes to the v2 handler. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **Glue — the Data Catalog operations** — the catalog operations were missing, so a client that creates or reads a catalog before its databases could not proceed. Catalog create, read and update are served.

### Internal
- **CI — install with uv and collect test shards in one pass** — the shard planner ran `pytest --collect-only` once per marker filter for counts a single pass already has, and superseded pull-request runs competed for runners. Installs go through uv, one collection pass yields both counts, and a concurrency group cancels superseded runs (never on `main`). No user-visible behavior changes. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **Lint — `F401` is enforced** — unused imports were ignored repo-wide pending a manual review; the review is done, the rule is on, and the four dead imports it found are gone. No user-visible behavior changes.
- **Testcontainers — `containerd` bumped to 1.7.35** in the Go example module, picking up CVE-2026-53495. No user-visible behavior changes.

## [1.5.9] — 2026-09-08

### Added
- **CloudFormation — a `WaitCondition` waits for its signals, `SignalResource` delivers them** — the handle's `Ref` is now a URL the emulator serves (`PUT` the AWS signal JSON with an empty `Content-Type`); the wait condition holds the stack until `Count` distinct SUCCESS signals arrive, a FAILURE or the `Timeout` rolls it back, signals are published to the stack events, and `Fn::GetAtt Wait.Data` is the `{UniqueId: Data}` map. The `CreationPolicy` form (`ResourceSignal`, default `PT5M`) is signalled through the new `SignalResource` action, by stack name or id. A nested stack now deploys on a worker thread, so a wait condition or custom resource inside it no longer blocks the server. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — stack-level tags propagate, and the `Tags` property of the common types reaches the service** — the 44 types with a tag property receive the stack tags and the three `aws:cloudformation:` tags on create and update (a key the template sets wins); `AWS::SQS::Queue`, `AWS::SNS::Topic`, `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`, `AWS::Lambda::Function`, `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` and `AWS::Kinesis::Stream` now store their own `Tags` where the service's list-tags call reads them. An empty `Tags` on `UpdateStack` removes them, more than 50 tags or an `aws:` key are refused, tags set through a service's own API survive stack updates, and a nested stack passes the tags on. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `ListImports`, `UpdateTerminationProtection`, `SetStackPolicy`, `GetStackPolicy`, `CancelUpdateStack` and `ContinueUpdateRollback`** — the first four answered `InvalidAction`, the last two did not exist, so an `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` stack had no way out. Termination protection makes `DeleteStack` refuse, `CancelUpdateStack` stops a running update before its next resource ("User Initiated"), and `ContinueUpdateRollback` retries the failed deletes, honouring `ResourcesToSkip`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — the list and describe actions page** — `DescribeStacks`, `ListStacks`, `DescribeStackEvents`, `ListStackResources`, `ListExports`, `ListImports` and `ListChangeSets` returned everything and ignored `NextToken`; they now return 100 items per page with a token for the rest (`ListExports` pages at 100 values on AWS, the others at 1 MB), a foreign token is a `ValidationError`, and events of one millisecond stay strictly newest-first across pages. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — dynamic references resolve** — `{{resolve:ssm:...}}`, `{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}` and `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}` resolve at provisioning time against the in-process stores, with the version, JSON key and version-stage segments; `GetTemplate` keeps the literal. On update an `ssm` reference re-resolves when the template or parameters changed, a `secretsmanager` reference only when its resource changed, as measured on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `DeletionPolicy` and `UpdateReplacePolicy` are honoured** — a `Retain` resource now stays (with a `DELETE_SKIPPED` event) on stack delete, on removal from the template and on replacement; `RetainExceptOnCreate` and `DeleteStack`'s `RetainResources` behave as the API documents; `Snapshot` deletes, since the emulator takes no snapshots. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Fixed
- **Lambda — the Docker executor extracts each code and layer zip once** — every cold start unpacked the code and layers into a fresh temporary directory that accumulated (a 30 MB function wrote 60 MB of disk per cold start). Extraction is now content-addressed into one shared read-only directory per distinct zip, so a repeat cold start writes nothing; entries are swept when the referencing function or layer version goes, and a state reset clears the cache.
- **S3 Tables / Glue — the Iceberg REST catalogs honour `upgrade-format-version`** — the commit action a Spark job sends for the `format-version` `3` table property was silently dropped, so the table kept reporting version 2; real S3 Tables supports Iceberg v3. Both catalogs now apply it atomically: re-asserting the current version is a no-op, a downgrade or a version above 3 is refused with 400 and commits nothing. The Glue-route createTable also honours the property — it is reserved, so it lands as the top-level metadata field and the rest of the request's properties reach the metadata's properties map.
- **CloudFormation — `Fn::Cidr`, `Fn::GetAZs`, `Fn::FindInMap` and the condition functions follow AWS** — `Fn::Cidr` now splits the block it is given (was `10.0.{i}.0/…` always; IPv6 included), `Fn::GetAZs` answers the stack's own zones (was a fabricated `a/b/c`), `Fn::FindInMap` gains `DefaultValue` and fails a missing key with `Template error: Unable to get mapping for M::x::y`, and `Fn::And`/`Fn::Or`/`Fn::Not` in a value position resolve to a boolean — all measured on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **S3 — the Multi-Region Access Point alias follows the documented pattern** — the alias was 13 uuid-hex characters, so a digit-only draw was possible; it now matches S3's `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*[.]mrap$`: a letter, then twelve lowercase letters or digits. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — parameter constraints are enforced** — `AllowedPattern`, `MinLength`, `MaxLength`, `MinValue` and `MaxValue` were ignored; they are checked before a stack exists with CloudFormation's message (`Parameter 'P' must match pattern ^[a-z]+$`, measured) or the `ConstraintDescription`, per member for a `CommaDelimitedList`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — an unregistered `AWS::CloudFormation::*` type is unrecognized, not a silent no-op** — `Macro`, `HookVersion`, `ModuleVersion` and any typo under the prefix deployed as a placeholder with a fabricated physical id; the pre-flight now refuses them like every other unrecognized type. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — the stack id addresses `GetTemplateSummary` and an UPDATE change set** — both looked the id up by name and answered "does not exist" while every other action accepted it; `DescribeStackResource(s)` also answered a request by id with the id in `StackName`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a change set sees `DeletionPolicy`, `UpdateReplacePolicy` and `Metadata` edits** — the diff compared `Properties` only, so a CDK `removalPolicy` edit ended `FAILED` with "didn't contain changes"; those attributes now count as a `Modify` with `Replacement: False`, reported in `Scope` and `Details`, while a `DependsOn`-only edit stays a no-change set, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a leftover whose delete failed stays visible, and the resource record serves `ResourceStatusReason`, `Metadata` and `LastUpdatedTimestamp`** — a resource dropped from the template whose cleanup delete failed vanished from the record while it kept existing, and `DeleteStack` never retried; it now stays listed as `DELETE_FAILED` with its reason, the next update and `DeleteStack` retry it. `DescribeStackResource(s)` carry `ResourceStatusReason`; the detail names its timestamp `LastUpdatedTimestamp` as `StackResourceDetail` defines (clients dropped the `Timestamp` element it sent) and returns the resource `Metadata` with intrinsics interpreted. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

## [1.5.8] — 2026-09-05

### Added
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::IoT::ThingGroup` provisions** — a stack carrying a thing group rolled back with `Unsupported resource type` while the thing-group API worked. The type now provisions through `CreateThingGroup` (`ThingGroupProperties` and `ParentGroupName` applied, a name generated when `ThingGroupName` is omitted), `Ref` returns the thing group id and `Fn::GetAtt` serves `Arn` and `Id`, as the resource reference documents; `ThingGroupProperties` updates in place, while `ThingGroupName` and `ParentGroupName` require replacement, a parent change under an unchanged custom name getting CloudFormation's own refusal. `QueryString` (dynamic groups) and `Tags` are accepted without effect: the service models neither. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFront — the policy, OAC and function types provision from CloudFormation** — `AWS::CloudFront::CachePolicy`, `OriginRequestPolicy`, `ResponseHeadersPolicy`, `OriginAccessControl` and `Function` had complete APIs and no provisioner, so a CDK app declaring any of them rolled the stack back with `Unsupported resource type`. Each now provisions by converting its properties to the element the service's own config parser accepts, `Ref`/`Fn::GetAtt` return the documented values (policy `Id`, OAC `Id`, function `FunctionARN`), deletes are wired, and an update replaces rather than mutating in place. Contributed by @mm-salesqueze.
- **S3 — Multi-Region Access Points deploy and serve** — `AWS::S3::MultiRegionAccessPoint` rolled the stack back with `Unsupported resource type` and the MRAP hostname resolved nowhere. The type now provisions, minting the `.mrap`-suffixed alias S3 uses and remembering its member buckets, and `<alias>.accesspoint.s3-global.amazonaws.com` resolves onto the existing virtual-hosted S3 path — the member whose bucket region matches the request region is served, else the first. SigV4A is not verified, consistent with the documented no-SigV4 stance, and the s3control control plane is not included. Contributed by @mm-salesqueze.
- **RDS — planned Aurora MySQL switchover runs on the data plane** — `SwitchoverGlobalCluster` (and `FailoverGlobalCluster` without data loss allowed) on a provisioned two-member Aurora MySQL 8 global cluster now performs a coordinated no-data-loss writer exchange: the source writer is fenced and drained, GTID convergence awaited, replication reversed and verified, and the promoted target verified writable, with conflicting mutations blocked mid-operation and recovery state persisted across restarts — an interrupted switchover is repaired by retrying the same request. Non-native configurations and `AllowDataLoss=true` keep the metadata-only path. Contributed by @Areson.
- **RDS — `FailoverDBCluster` promotes replicated PostgreSQL readers** — with `MINISTACK_RDS_PG_CLUSTER_REPLICATION=1`, failover now calls `pg_promote()` on the selected hot standby, makes it the writer endpoint, and re-clones the former writer with `pg_basebackup` as a read-only standby. Metadata changes only after promotion succeeds; shared-container clusters retain their existing metadata-only behavior. Contributed by @kiran01bm.

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation — stack updates stop destroying resources** — a changed property on a type without an update handler fell through to a destructive re-create: generated-identity types came back empty under a new id with the old resource orphaned (Cognito pools and clients, Secrets Manager secrets, API Gateway authorizers and deployments), name-keyed ones wiped their data (Kinesis records, ECR images, group members, alarm state and history), and others failed the stack outright (any Route53 record edit, any EventBus property change). Nineteen types now update in place through their service's own APIs — `AWS::Cognito::UserPool`/`UserPoolClient`/`IdentityPool`/`UserPoolGroup` (including `EnabledMfas` via `SetUserPoolMfaConfig`), `AWS::SecretsManager::Secret` (a changed value becomes the new `AWSCURRENT`, same ARN, history kept), `AWS::Kinesis::Stream`, `AWS::ECR::Repository`, `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable`, `AWS::Events::EventBus`, `AWS::Events::Rule`, `AWS::CodeBuild::Project`, `AWS::Route53::RecordSet`, `AWS::Scheduler::Schedule`, `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`, `AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm`, `AWS::IAM::Policy`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Authorizer`, `AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment` and `AWS::KMS::Alias` — only the properties the resource references mark *Replacement* replace (the new resource is created before the old one is removed, and a custom-named resource requiring replacement gets CloudFormation's own refusal), and a property the template drops reverts to its create default. The engine gains real replacement semantics: when an update returns a new physical id, the predecessor is deleted in a cleanup phase, as CloudFormation does after `UPDATE_COMPLETE`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Lambda::Permission` is replaced on update and removed on delete** — a stack update that changed a permission fell through to the create handler and appended a second statement, a permission declared without the legacy `Id` was never removed at all, and `EventSourceToken`, `FunctionUrlAuthType`, `InvokedViaFunctionUrl`, `PrincipalOrgID` and `SourceAccount` were dropped on the way to the statement. Every property of the type requires replacement, so an update now removes the old statement and adds the new one under a fresh generated Sid — the resource's physical id, the shape real CloudFormation mints — and all nine documented properties reach the statement as conditions. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a failed update keeps the pre-existing resources when it rolls back** — the rollback of a failed stack update deleted every resource the run had touched, and a run touches every resource in the template: unchanged resources and resources updated in place went down together with what the update had actually created. The rollback now deletes only what the update created and replacements under a new physical id; a resource that kept its physical id is left standing. An in-place change is not reverted, and a replacement's old resource, already removed by the update, is not recreated. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — a rolled-back update reports what the stack ran before** — after `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`, `GetTemplate` returned the template that failed and `DescribeStacks` the failed update's parameters and tags, so a `cdk diff` after a failed deploy compared against the wrong base. The rollback now restores the previous template body, parameters and tags together with the resources and outputs. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — an export counts as in use only when a stack imports it** — `DeleteStack` searched the serialized templates of every other stack for the export name, so a stack that merely carried the name in a string value blocked the delete, while an import through a resolved `Fn::ImportValue` argument did not. The check now walks the other stacks' `Fn::ImportValue` uses and resolves their arguments against those stacks' own parameters, as CloudFormation does. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `UpdateStack` without changes is refused** — an identical `TemplateBody`, or `UsePreviousTemplate` with unchanged parameters, ran an empty update where CloudFormation answers `ValidationError: No updates are to be performed.`, so a "deploy until nothing changes" loop never ended. The request is refused when the template, every resolved parameter and the tags (when sent) equal what the stack runs; a changed parameter value or tag set is still an update. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — unrecognized resource types are rejected up front, `Fn::GetAtt` to a missing attribute fails the stack** — a template with a resource type the emulator does not know provisioned every resource ahead of it before rolling back; `CreateStack`, `UpdateStack`, `CreateChangeSet` and `ValidateTemplate` now refuse it synchronously with CloudFormation's own `Template format error: Unrecognized resource types: [...]` and leave no stack behind, and dynamic references (`{{resolve:ssm:...}}`, `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`), which the emulator does not resolve, are refused the same way. `Fn::GetAtt` to an attribute a resource does not expose answered with the physical id, a silently wrong value; it now fails the operation with `Requested attribute X does not exist in schema for T`, and outputs are resolved before the success path commits, so a failing output rolls back too and registers no export. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `DeleteChangeSet` of a change set that does not exist succeeds** — it answered `ChangeSetNotFound` (404) where a real account answers a plain success, so the CDK — which removes a possible leftover `cdk-deploy-change-set` before every deploy and only tolerates `ChangeSetNotFoundException` — aborted every `cdk deploy` of an already deployed stack. The stack is now resolved by name or stack ID first; a stack that does not exist is still a `ValidationError`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Events::Rule` reports the rule ARN the EventBridge service reports** — `Fn::GetAtt` `Arn` was built with the bus name in every case, so a rule on the default bus answered `rule/default/<name>` while `DescribeRule` for the same rule answered `rule/<name>`. The provisioner now derives the ARN through the service's own helper: no bus segment on the default bus, `rule/<bus>/<name>` on a custom one. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Cognito::UserPool` reads `UserPoolName`** — the provisioner read `PoolName`, the API's name for the property, where the resource reference defines `UserPoolName`, so every pool declared with the documented property came up under a generated `<stack>-<logical id>` name. `UserPoolName` is honoured now; `PoolName` stays accepted for templates written against MiniStack. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudWatch — `PutMetricAlarm` keeps the state timestamp of an existing alarm** — re-putting an alarm stamped a fresh `StateUpdatedTimestamp` on every call, so an alarm that had been in `ALARM` for an hour reported a state change that never happened whenever its configuration was touched. The state, its reason and its timestamp now stay across the re-put and only `AlarmConfigurationUpdatedTimestamp` moves, as the API reference documents; both request encodings. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IAM enforcement — the remaining S3 operations authorize as S3 documents them** — with `AUTH=true`, a browser `POST Object` was checked as `s3:DeleteObject`, a request naming a `versionId` as the unversioned action, `DeleteObjects` once against the bucket ARN (so a grant on `arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*` denied every batch delete), `CopyObject` / `UploadPartCopy` without `s3:GetObject` on the source, and fifteen sub-resources fell to the method default. Each now maps to the action the S3 reference lists, a `versionId` resolves to the `*Version*` action, and both enforcement sites run the per-request checks (per key, source object, attributes pair, governance bypass). Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **DynamoDB — PartiQL and validation parity measured against real DynamoDB** — `ExecuteStatement` serves `SELECT` from `"table"."index"` (membership, projection, ordering and consumed capacity follow the index; an LSI reaches back to the base table for unprojected attributes, a GSI rejects them), document paths in `SET`/`REMOVE`, `OR` predicates and `RETURNING MODIFIED OLD/NEW *` computed from the paths actually changed; `BatchExecuteStatement` reports per-statement error entries and `ExecuteTransaction` validates every member before applying anything. `Query` and `Scan` answer the `Select`/`ProjectionExpression` refusals with real DynamoDB's wording, a `KeyConditionExpression` on a nested attribute is rejected (`KeyConditionExpressions cannot have conditions on nested attributes`), `ConsumedCapacity` lands on the index arm for index reads, and writes validate secondary-index key values — wrong-typed or empty as a `ValidationException` on single writes and as a positional cancellation reason in transactions. Reported by the paritysuite.org project.
- **Lambda — durable executions emit the complete history event set** — four of the documented history event types were never emitted. Each handler invocation now records `InvocationCompleted`; `DurableConfig.ExecutionTimeout` is enforced — the execution lands `TIMED_OUT` with an `ExecutionTimedOut` event and every in-flight chained invoke gets its own `ChainedInvokeTimedOut`; `StopDurableExecution` marks in-flight chained invokes with `ChainedInvokeStopped`; and `ChainedInvokeStarted` is on the log before a fast child can complete.
- **Cognito — the PreSignUp trigger fires on plain `SignUp`** — only federated sign-ups invoked it; a pool's `LambdaConfig.PreSignUp` now runs before the user is persisted, fail-closed: `autoConfirmUser` confirms the account (no code delivery), `autoVerifyEmail`/`autoVerifyPhone` mark the attributes, and a rejecting or failing trigger blocks the sign-up with `UserLambdaValidationException`, per the trigger's documented contract.
- **STS — sessions expire and the store stops growing** — `GetCallerIdentity` with expired temporary credentials answers `403 ExpiredToken` ("The security token included in the request is expired", the documented STS error), and expired sessions are evicted as new ones register — previously every AssumeRole and vended identity-pool credential lived in memory forever.

## [1.5.7] — 2026-09-04

### Added
- **Cognito — identity pool principal tag attribute maps** — `SetPrincipalTagAttributeMap` and `GetPrincipalTagAttributeMap` were missing, so a CDK or CloudFormation deployment declaring `AWS::Cognito::IdentityPoolPrincipalTag` rolled the stack back. The operations round-trip a per-provider mapping on the identity pool, per botocore `cognito-identity-2014-06-30`: both members optional and stored as sent, an unconfigured provider answers `ResourceNotFoundException` with `No Principal Tags configured for Provider {name}`, and each provider keeps its own map. `UseDefaults` is not expanded into a tag map — AWS applies the default claim mapping when vending credentials — and is accepted alongside `PrincipalTags`, as terraform-provider-aws sends on destroy. The CloudFormation resource keys its physical id on the pool/provider pair, applies a changed `PrincipalTags` in place, and clears the mapping on delete or replacement. State is account- and region-scoped and persisted. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **EC2 — cross-account AMI sharing** — a registered image was invisible to other accounts, with no way to grant access, so a Terraform `aws_ami` lookup across simulated accounts found nothing. `ModifyImageAttribute` applies `launchPermission` add/remove in both wire forms (structured `LaunchPermission.Add/Remove` and legacy `Attribute`+`OperationType`+`UserId`/`UserGroup`), `DescribeImageAttribute` and `ResetImageAttribute` round-trip and revoke it, and `DescribeImages` shows another account's image when the caller holds a permission or `all` is granted — keeping the owner's `OwnerId`, flipping `Public` on `Group=all`, honouring `ExecutableUsers` and `Owners`, shapes per botocore `ec2-2016-11-15`. A shared AMI launches through the same permission check. A non-owner modifying an image answers `AuthFailure` "Not authorized for image:{id}", as real EC2 does; an unknown id keeps `InvalidAMIID.NotFound`. Reported by @edersonbrilhante.
- **API Gateway — IAM-authorized methods report the caller's identity** — a REST method with `authorizationType: AWS_IAM` handed its Lambda only `sourceIp` and `userAgent`; the resolved caller now fills the payload-1.0 fields (`accessKey`, `accountId`, `caller`, `user`, `userArn`, `principalOrgId` from the account's Organization when one exists) and, for identity-pool credentials, the four `cognito*` fields — `cognitoAuthenticationProvider` in the documented `<provider>,<provider>:CognitoSignIn:<sub>` format. HTTP API `AWS_IAM` routes reject a request with no `Authorization` header (`403 Forbidden`) and fill `requestContext.authorizer.iam` (`accessKey`, `accountId`, `callerId`, `userArn`, `userId`, `cognitoIdentity` with `amr`/`identityId`/`identityPoolId`). Signatures are not verified — key resolution only, per the documented no-SigV4 stance. `GetCredentialsForIdentity` also registers its credentials as an STS session — `GetCallerIdentity` reports `arn:aws:sts::<account>:assumed-role/<PoolRole>/CognitoIdentityCredentials`, as on AWS — so identity-pool credentials work under `AUTH=true` instead of being rejected as an invalid token. Reported by @iot-rocket.

### Changed
- **RDS — Aurora MySQL global writer switchover foundations** — deadline-bounded helpers for writer fencing, GTID convergence, replication-channel management and verified write enablement, plus lifecycle guards reserving clusters mid-switchover. No user-visible behavior changes; dormant until an orchestrator calls them. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **Lambda — a Docker-executed function sees its real ARN in `context.invoked_function_arn`** — the RIE inside the official images hardcodes `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:012345678912:function:{name}`, account and region, so a handler self-registering its own ARN (the standard pattern for wiring a Cognito trigger) stored a scope where nothing exists and the trigger never fired. Python and Node.js zip functions run through a shim handing user code the control-plane ARN; for `provided` and Image-type functions, where MiniStack owns no code path, an ARN carrying exactly the RIE's hardcoded scope resolves as the caller's own function, so a stored trigger still fires. Reported by @TomaszKupka.
- **Cognito — TOTP codes verify** — `VerifySoftwareToken` answered `SUCCESS` for any six digits and the `SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA` challenge issued tokens for any code. The `AssociateSoftwareToken` secret is now stored and verified with RFC 6238 (HMAC-SHA1, 30-second step, ±1 step): a wrong code answers `EnableSoftwareTokenMFAException` on verify and `CodeMismatchException` on the challenge, both in the operations' botocore error models, and success promotes the secret and enrolls the user. The CloudFormation provisioner maps `EnabledMfas: [SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA]` (what CDK emits) onto `GetUserPoolMfaConfig`. Tests sending a fixed code must derive one from the `SecretCode` they receive; users enrolled before this release keep the old behavior until re-enrolment. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — the Aurora reader endpoint is a name that resolves** — `CreateDBCluster` handed out an AWS-shaped `cluster-ro-` name that nothing registered, so a consumer that stored it (Terraform reads `reader_endpoint` during the creating apply) held an unresolvable endpoint, hanging until client timeout. The reader name is registered as a Docker network alias alongside the writer name, and `DescribeDBClusters` reports it whenever the writer reports its stable name — per the Aurora documentation, a cluster with no replicas resolves its reader endpoint to the primary. With PG streaming replication on, the name stays off the writer so a standby can carry it. Outside alias mode everything behaves as before. Reported by @jbschooley.
- **CloudWatch — Timestamp members over JSON are epoch numbers** — the awsJson1_0 branches returned the XML path's ISO strings, which AWS SDK timestamp parsers reject (`Expected real number, got implicit NaN`), failing `GetMetricStatistics`, `GetMetricData` and `DescribeAlarmHistory` reads. Timestamps convert to integer epoch seconds at the JSON serialization boundary. Contributed by @mm-salesqueze.
- **CloudFront — `GetDistribution` returns a config every SDK can read** — re-serialising the client's namespaced `config_xml` made ElementTree invent an `ns0:` prefix on every child, which REST-XML SDK parsers read as absent, so `Origins`, `DefaultCacheBehavior` and `CallerReference` were invisible on read-back. The re-parsed config has its namespaces stripped, on all four response paths. Contributed by @mm-salesqueze.
- **STS — cross-account `AssumeRole` works, and an assumed session runs in the right account** — the role was resolved in the caller's account, so a cross-account role was never found and refused under `AUTH=true`; and a session's non-12-digit key fell back to the default account, so every assumed session saw the wrong tenant while `AssumeRole` reported success. The role resolves in the account its ARN names — the ARN's account is authoritative, a miss stays the `AccessDenied` real STS returns without disclosing role existence — and a session key resolves to the account of the role it assumed. Contributed by @mm-salesqueze.
- **CloudFormation — a stack addressed by its unique stack ID deletes and updates** — every `StackName` parameter accepts the name or the stack ID per the API reference, and the CDK CLI addresses stacks by ARN; `DeleteStack` resolved the name only, so `cdk destroy` returned OK and deleted nothing, and an update by ID hung in `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS`. Both — plus `DescribeStackResource(s)`, `DescribeStackEvents`, `ListStackResources` and `GetTemplate` — resolve either form through one helper. Contributed by @mm-salesqueze.
- **CodeBuild — a build the agent never ran no longer reports `SUCCEEDED`** — the local agent exits 0 after failing to start anything (denied the Docker socket under SELinux), and the outcome was read off the exit code alone. A zero exit with no completed phase lands the build `FAULT`. The agent container also takes extra `docker run` flags through `CODEBUILD_DOCKER_FLAGS` — same syntax and parser as `LAMBDA_DOCKER_FLAGS`, both gaining `--security-opt` — the only lever that makes the agent work under SELinux. Contributed by @mm-salesqueze.
- **SNS — a Lambda subscription delivers for every account** — the delivery thread resolved the subscriber with an empty request context, reading back the default account, so a tenant under a 12-digit key had every SNS→Lambda notification silently dropped. The publisher's context travels into the delivery thread. The CloudWatch Logs subscription-filter delivery had the sibling defect and now invokes through the function's own account and region.
- **Pagination tokens are omitted when empty** — MSK, Organizations, WAF Classic, Bedrock agent/runtime, AppSync item listings and the Lambda durable/microVM surfaces emitted `NextToken: null` or `NextMarker: ""` on every list; a present-but-empty token reads as real to non-boto clients and as drift to Terraform. All now omit the member, matching the models.
- **ElastiCache — `DescribeCacheClusters` reports `CacheClusterCreateTime`** — the cluster-level creation time was stored but never serialized; it is emitted as ISO8601 alongside the node-level times.
- **DynamoDB — ContributorInsights timestamps are integer epoch** — `LastUpdateDateTime` was a float on the wire, against the JSON timestamp convention.
- **EC2 — the seeded public AMIs carry their real owners** — the stub images reported no owner, so `Owners=["amazon"]` (Terraform's `aws_ami` data source) selected nothing. They carry the real publishing accounts — 137112412989 for Amazon Linux, 801119661308 for Windows, 099720109477 for Canonical — with `ImageOwnerAlias: amazon` on the Amazon-published pair, as `DescribeImages` reports on AWS.

## [1.5.6] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **Amazon Transcribe (`transcribe`)** — new service emulator for batch transcription jobs: `StartTranscriptionJob`, `GetTranscriptionJob`, `ListTranscriptionJobs`, `DeleteTranscriptionJob`, verified against botocore `transcribe-2017-10-26`. Jobs walk `QUEUED` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETED` (paced by `TRANSCRIBE_JOB_RUN_SECONDS`), read their media from MiniStack S3 by `s3://`, path-style or virtual-hosted URI, and write the transcript back to S3 in the real result format, with `IdentifyLanguage`/`IdentifyMultipleLanguages`, `ContentRedaction`, `Subtitles` and speaker labels honoured and a `Transcribe Job State Change` event published on the default bus at terminal states. The transcript is deterministic canned text — there is no speech recognition. Streaming, call-analytics and medical jobs, custom vocabularies and tagging are not implemented. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **Lambda — SnapStart** — the `SnapStart` parameter on `CreateFunction` and `UpdateFunctionConfiguration` was silently swallowed, so a deployment that enables it saw permanent Terraform drift. It now round-trips: `$LATEST` echoes `ApplyOn` with `OptimizationStatus: Off`, a published version reports `On` and walks `Pending` → `Active`, and the documented constraints are enforced — Java 11+/Python 3.12+/.NET 8+ zip runtimes only (container images accepted), no ephemeral storage above 512 MB, refused with `InvalidParameterValueException`. The mechanism is emulated, not just the shape: publishing initializes the version's execution environment right then (warm worker or RIE container), so the first invoke is warm, invoking while `Pending` answers `ResourceConflictException`, a broken init fails the publish (`State: Failed`), and `snapshot-restore-py` before-snapshot/after-restore hooks run during a published version's init. No snapshot exists locally; Java CRaC and .NET hooks do not fire.
- **RDS — MySQL writer quiescence primitives** — writer-fence verification, transaction/XA drain inventory and fenced GTID capture for Aurora MySQL global-cluster switchover, deadline-bounded and fail-closed; dormant until a switchover orchestrator calls them. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Glue / S3 Tables — Iceberg-Spark catalog for Glue 5.0** — jobs declaring `GlueVersion` 5.0 resolve the Iceberg-Spark catalog, covering the dispatch and parse differences between Spark 3.5 and 3.3 and Iceberg v3, and the embedded Iceberg REST catalog now serves clients beyond DuckDB and Spark: `createNamespace` is routed instead of answering an internal error, and the pyiceberg-visible defects (format-version, unresolved schema-id) are fixed. Reported by @kevinprince.

### Fixed
- **ALB — the `authenticate-oidc` listener action authenticates** — the action's config was accepted and discarded, so every request reached the target unauthenticated. The documented flow now runs end to end: redirect to the `AuthorizationEndpoint`, code exchange at the `TokenEndpoint`, claims from the `UserInfoEndpoint`, session in sharded `AWSELBAuthSessionCookie` cookies, and targets receive `x-amzn-oidc-identity`, `x-amzn-oidc-accesstoken` and `x-amzn-oidc-data` — the last as AWS's signed ES256 JWT (`kid`, `signer`, `iss`, `client`, `exp`; base64 segments padded, as ALB emits them) with client-supplied copies stripped. Rule actions now run as a chain in `Order`, and `ModifyListener` updates the default rule the data plane serves. `authenticate-cognito` answers `501`. Contributed by @dhanesh.
- **Router — an unregistered `Host` is no longer routed by service-token substring** — the host-pattern step ran unanchored `iot\.`, `logs\.`, `email\.` regexes over any unclassified `Host`, so `probe.iot.example.com` answered `Unsupported IoT path` and `logs.example.com` landed in CloudWatch Logs. Host patterns are now consulted only for hosts the stack serves — a single label, a two-label alias, an IP literal, or a name under `localhost`, `amazonaws.com`, `MINISTACK_HOST` or the container hostname, matched at a label boundary — and each service token is anchored at a label start, so `probe-iot.localhost` is not IoT while `<bucket>.s3.<region>`, `<api-id>.execute-api.<region>` and the other AWS shapes route exactly as before. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IAM — the AWS-managed policies a CDK, SAM or Serverless deployment attaches resolve by their real ARNs** — the seeded catalogue filed the Lambda execution-role policies under `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/<Name>` while AWS publishes them under `…:policy/service-role/<Name>`, the only ARN those tools emit, so `GetPolicy` answered `NoSuchEntity` and under `AUTH=true` an attached policy granted nothing. The catalogue now carries them under their real path with the documents from the AWS Managed Policy Reference, reports `PolicyName` and `Path` as AWS does, and adds the missing CDK/API Gateway/IoT and SQS/Kinesis/DynamoDB execution-role policies. The path-less spellings answer `NoSuchEntity`, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IAM enforcement — the `aws:ResourceAccount` condition key resolves** — with `AUTH=true` a statement conditioned on `aws:ResourceAccount` (or `s3:ResourceAccount`) never matched, so CDK's own bootstrap template failed asset publishing. The key resolves to the resource-owning account (the ARN's account field wins); a condition naming another account still denies, and every other unknown key keeps denying. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IAM enforcement — S3 multipart uploads authorize as `s3:PutObject`** — `CreateMultipartUpload` was checked as a literal action no policy grants, so every upload above the SDK's multipart threshold was denied. The multipart operations now map to the actions S3 documents (`s3:PutObject`, `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`, the two listing actions), `?versions` is `s3:ListBucketVersions`, object-level `?tagging`/`?acl` use the object actions, and configuration `DELETE`s authorize as their `Put*` action. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — a failed Docker cold start no longer leaks its extraction directory** — anything raised between unpacking the code/layers and the container start (a corrupt layer zip, a Docker socket read-timeout) orphaned a full `ministack-lambda-docker-*` tree, compounding to gigabytes under Docker-API pressure. Cleanup now covers every exit until the container is handed to the warm pool. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — a container worker no longer clobbers an intervened stop** — `StopDBInstance` landing while the background worker was still starting the instance's container was undone when the worker finished and set the status back to `available`; the worker now finishes without overwriting a stop, so `DBInstanceStatus` and DB-proxy `TargetHealth` stay `stopped`/`UNAVAILABLE`.

## [1.5.5] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- **Bedrock — Knowledge Base ingestion reads the bucket, and `Retrieve` retrieves** — `StartIngestionJob` answered `COMPLETE` with an all-zero statistics block without touching the data source, and `Retrieve` answered `[]` forever, so a green ingestion run was indistinguishable from a working one. The job now reads the S3 data source (honouring `inclusionPrefixes`) and reports real statistics — scanned, new versus modified, and non-UTF-8 documents as failed with a reason each; a source it cannot read at all (missing bucket, non-S3 type) lands `FAILED` with `failureReasons` instead of a fabricated success. `Retrieve` searches the ingested documents lexically and returns content, the `s3Location` of each hit and a score, `ResourceNotFoundException` for an unknown knowledge base. Reported by @bradleyhet.
- **KMS — multi-Region keys and `ReplicateKey`** — `CreateKey` with `MultiRegion` mints an `mrk-` key carrying `MultiRegionConfiguration`, and `ReplicateKey` creates a same-id replica in another region sharing the key material, so a ciphertext from the primary decrypts against the replica. Invalid sources and occupied regions are refused as on AWS, and deleting a primary with live replicas lands `PendingReplicaDeletion`. Reported by @cringdahl.

### Changed
- **RDS — the Aurora MySQL replication channel operations are role-independent** — No user-visible behavior changes. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **RDS — a cluster endpoint is a stable name, not the container's current address** — the endpoint reported for a cluster changed as it came up (an AWS-shaped hostname, then `localhost`, then the container's IP), so anything that stored it — Terraform reads once, at create — held a value that went stale whenever the container was replaced. The AWS-shaped endpoint the cluster already advertises is now registered as a Docker network alias on its container and reported unchanged, so the stored value keeps resolving after a replacement. Skipped where Docker refuses aliases (the default bridge), which behaves exactly as before; `localhost` and `MINISTACK_HOST` never qualify as aliases. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **Gateway — a gzip-compressed request body is inflated before the service reads it** — smithy's `@requestCompression` trait makes an AWS SDK gzip a request body once it passes `REQUEST_MIN_COMPRESSION_SIZE_BYTES` (default 10240) and send `Content-Encoding: gzip`; CloudWatch `PutMetricData` carries the trait, so boto3 compresses it with no client configuration. The handler parsed the compressed bytes, so a `PutMetricData` call of more than 10 KB answered `200` and stored nothing, losing every datapoint in the batch without an error. The body is now inflated once the target service is known and the gzip token dropped from `Content-Encoding`. S3 is excluded: there `Content-Encoding` is object metadata, so a gzip upload keeps the exact bytes it was sent and returns the header on `GetObject`. Contributed by @Lukasdoe.
- **Bedrock — guardrails guard** — `ApplyGuardrail` evaluated nothing: every input answered `action: NONE` with an empty assessment, a nonexistent guardrail id answered HTTP 200, and `Converse` ignored `guardrailConfig` entirely, so a guardrail test suite went green while letting everything through. The deterministic policies are now enforced — word policy, the sensitive-information regexes, and the pattern-matchable PII types (EMAIL, PHONE, IP/MAC address, URL, SSN, card numbers, AWS keys) with `BLOCK` and `ANONYMIZE` honoured per input/output stage — with the documented response anatomy: `GUARDRAIL_INTERVENED`, the blocked messaging as output, and the per-policy assessment. `Converse` and `ConverseStream` apply the same evaluation to both stages (`stopReason: guardrail_intervened`, guardrail trace on request), and an unknown id answers `ResourceNotFoundException` everywhere. The model-graded policies (topic, content, contextual grounding, `PROFANITY`) still need a classifier and are not evaluated. Reported by @bradleyhet.
- **Bedrock — `InvokeAgent` no longer fabricates an `ORCHESTRATE` trace** — with `enableTrace` the canned reply was preceded by an `orchestrationTrace` describing reasoning that never ran, which made the absence of orchestration harder to detect from the one artifact a developer would check. No trace events are emitted. Reported by @bradleyhet.
- **Cognito — `PreventUserExistenceErrors=ENABLED` hides an unknown user** — `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, `USER_SRP_AUTH` and `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` answer `NotAuthorizedException` (at `RespondToAuthChallenge` too, which is what closes SRP), `ForgotPassword` and `ResendConfirmationCode` answer a simulated `CodeDeliveryDetails` with the masked `Destination` (`j****@e****`), and `ConfirmForgotPassword` answers `CodeMismatchException`. Admin *directory* operations keep `UserNotFoundException`, and `CUSTOM_AUTH` is untouched. Contributed by @fhfournier.
- **Lambda — SQS event source mapping records carry `AWSTraceHeader` and the FIFO attributes** — the trace header and `MessageGroupId`/`MessageDeduplicationId`/`SequenceNumber` were dropped from the event's `attributes` map; each now rides the record when set, per the documented event shape. Reported by @future-h-takeda-g3.
- **Request bodies assemble in linear time** — the ASGI body reader, the aws-chunked decoder, S3 `CompleteMultipartUpload` and the DSQL proxy's row serialization each rebuilt an immutable `bytes` per chunk; all four now collect and join once, taking a 95 MB `PutObject` from ~23 s to ~0.3 s. Reported by @vernonhaughton.

## [1.5.4] — 2026-08-31

### Added
- **AppSync — `APPSYNC_JS` resolvers execute** — resolver code was stored and never run; `request()` now decides what the data source is asked for and `response()` shapes the answer, with `util.error`, `util.appendError` and `runtime.earlyReturn` following AWS in both of its documented positions, pipeline resolvers threading `ctx.stash`, and `extensions.evictFromApiCache` recorded back to the service. `NONE`, `HTTP`, `AMAZON_DYNAMODB` and `AWS_LAMBDA` data sources execute; the remaining types refuse with `NotImplemented`. Evaluation runs on a pool of Node workers — one evaluation in flight per worker, a 30-second bound with kill-and-respawn, a heap cap, and resolver console output surfaced in the service log. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **AppSync — queries are parsed and executed with `graphql-core`** — the regex data plane failed silently on aliases, fragments, nested selection sets, variables with defaults and directives; an API with a schema now parses, validates and executes with the reference engine (an AppSync prelude supplies the `AWS*` scalars and `@aws_*` directives), while a schemaless API keeps the previous lenient path. Adds `graphql-core` as a dependency. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **AppSync — schema creation, pipeline functions, environment variables and the `Update*` operations** — `StartSchemaCreation`, `GetSchemaCreationStatus`, `GetIntrospectionSchema` (SDL verbatim, or a real introspection document for `format=JSON`), the function operations, `Put`/`GetGraphqlApiEnvironmentVariables` and `UpdateDataSource` / `UpdateResolver` / `UpdateFunction` / `UpdateType` all answered `Unsupported route`. `CreateGraphqlApi` also omitted `apiType`, `visibility` and `introspectionConfig` and left tags off the API object, so a no-change Terraform plan proposed replacing the API; required members are validated rather than silently defaulted. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **AppSync — the API cache, control plane and data plane** — the five `ApiCache` operations answered `Unsupported route`; they now round-trip a record carrying `healthMetricsConfig`, with `ttl` (1–3600), `apiCachingBehavior` and `type` required and validated as on AWS, and the data plane serves query resolvers from the cache under both caching behaviors, mutations excluded. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **AppSync — nested type resolvers, `ctx.identity` from Cognito, `ctx.env` and `ctx.error`** — only top-level `Query`/`Mutation` fields resolved and `ctx.identity` was only ever set by a Lambda authorizer; a resolved value's type now runs its own resolvers with the parent as `ctx.source`, a Cognito token populates `ctx.identity`, and `response()` sees a data source failure as `ctx.error`. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **AppSync — the `@aws-appsync/utils/dynamodb` helpers, and `EvaluateCode`** — the helper sub-module was stripped with every other import, so `ddb.get`/`put`/`update`/`remove`/`scan`/`query` died with "ddb is not defined"; they are provided and bound to whatever name the import used, and `EvaluateCode` tests a handler before it is attached to an API. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **AppSync — `util.transform` DynamoDB expression builders and the rest of the `util` surface** — `util.transform` was an empty object and 8 of the 21 members `@aws-appsync/utils` declares were provided; `toDynamoDBFilterExpression`/`toDynamoDBConditionExpression` now build the `{expression, expressionNames, expressionValues}` triple over AWS's documented operator set, and the missing `util` members (`base64*`, `url*`, `escapeJavaScript`, `matches`, `authType`, real `autoUlid`/`autoKsuid`, `util.str`, `util.math`, `util.time`, the `util.dynamodb` `to*` family, `util.rds.toJsonObject`) are implemented, with the rest refusing by name. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **Aurora DSQL — foreign key constraints** — every `REFERENCES` / `FOREIGN KEY` clause was refused `0A000`; they now reach the backend as written, with the two DSQL-specific rules enforced against a live cluster (eu-central-1, 2026-08-30): `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... FOREIGN KEY` must use `NOT VALID`, and `DEFERRABLE` is refused on any other kind of constraint, in the service's own wordings. Contributed by @vivedo.
- **Aurora DSQL — change data capture streams, and `GetVpcEndpointServiceName`** — the four CDC stream operations answered `ValidationException`; streams now create, describe, list, page, tag and delete with the API's shapes (`clientToken` idempotency, the 5-per-cluster quota as `ServiceQuotaExceededException`). Metadata only: no change record reaches the Kinesis target, and a visibly broken target lands the stream `FAILED` with the service's `statusReason` code. `GetVpcEndpointServiceName` answers a stable per-cluster name. Contributed by @vivedo.
- **Aurora DSQL — `SELECT ... FOR KEY SHARE`** — refused `0A000` alongside `FOR SHARE` and `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` although the live service takes it since 2026-08-25; it is now forwarded, and only the other two are refused. Contributed by @vivedo.
- **IoT Core — `ListThingGroupsForThing`** — the reverse lookup answered `Unsupported IoT path`, so resolving a thing's groups meant scanning every group; it now returns `{groupName, groupArn}` pairs from the bidirectional membership store, with `ResourceNotFoundException` for an unknown thing. The full list comes back in one page, like the service's other list operations. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::IoT::CACertificate` provisions onto the CA registry** — a template declaring the type rolled the stack back with `Unsupported resource type`. The provisioner now drives the real API: create registers the PEM with `RegistrationConfig` and `CertificateMode` (stored and reported by `DescribeCACertificate`, `DEFAULT` when omitted), update applies `Status` / `AutoRegistrationStatus` / `RegistrationConfig` / `RemoveAutoRegistration` in place, and delete deactivates first, because an ACTIVE CA refuses `DeleteCACertificate`. A PEM that is already registered fails the create, as CloudFormation does for an existing resource, and a changed `CACertificatePem` or `CertificateMode` fails the update loudly rather than silently replacing the CA — the id is derived from the certificate content. `Tags` are not modeled. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **KMS — `GenerateRandom`** — the one keyless KMS operation answered `InvalidAction`; it now returns the requested 1–1024 bytes from `os.urandom`, refuses an omitted or out-of-range `NumberOfBytes` with the service's `ValidationException` wording, answers `CustomKeyStoreNotFoundException` for a `CustomKeyStoreId`, and refuses the Nitro-enclave `Recipient` parameter loudly rather than answering a plaintext shape real KMS never returns there. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Changed
- **AppSync — an API's auth modes are enforced** — a data-plane request satisfying none of the API's configured providers now answers `401 UnauthorizedException`, as on AWS; previously an API declaring `AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS` served a caller with no credentials at all. Credentials are still not verified — what is refused is the absence of any credential. Contributed by @jbschooley.

### Fixed
- **Persistence — a module that failed to load no longer overwrites its state** — the stand-in for a module that cannot import reported empty state and `save_all` wrote it over the service's file, so one bad boot silently destroyed everything that service had persisted; the stand-in now reports `None` and the file is left alone. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **ECS — a restored service relaunches its tasks** — a restart restored every task `STOPPED` (its container went with the process) and nothing reconciled the services, so a service reported its persisted `runningCount` while nothing listened; ACTIVE services are now reconciled once after a restore on a daemon thread, a service that cannot relaunch is logged and skipped, and ECS joins the boot eager-load list when persisted services exist so a workload reached only through a load balancer recovers too. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **Six fields accepted on write but never reported on read** — Lambda's `EventSourceMappingArn` (absent on create/get/list, so Terraform read no ESM tags), s3control's `ListTagsForResource` tag wrapper (`<member>` where the model says `<Tag>`, unparseable by aws-sdk-go-v2), Kinesis's `KeyId` alongside `EncryptionType`, RDS's `ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration` and `PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod`, and Cognito's `UserAttributeUpdateSettings` and a disabled `SoftwareTokenMfaConfiguration` all round-trip now, each omitted when never set so an unset field does not read as drift. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **ECS — a task runs on the architecture its task definition declares** — `runtimePlatform` was stored and never read, so Docker chose the host's architecture and an `ARM64` task on an x86_64 host started a container that could not execute its entrypoint; the declared architecture is now passed to Docker. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **Lambda — a function runs on the architecture it declares** — the container was created without a platform whatever `Architectures` said; the declared architecture is now passed to Docker, and a cached image of the wrong architecture is re-pulled rather than failing opaquely at run. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **AppSync — an anonymous operation that declares variables is parsed** — `mutation($x: T!) { … }` with no space after the keyword — what every SDK sends — never matched the operation pattern, so the whole document was read as one field named "mutation" and answered null with no error. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **AppSync — resolver execution no longer blocks the event loop** — a resolver whose data source calls back into MiniStack deadlocked the request; execution and `EvaluateCode` now run on worker threads. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **Cognito — `AdminListUserAuthEvents` requires user-pool add-ons** — the call answered `{"AuthEvents": []}` for every pool where AWS refuses with `UserPoolAddOnNotEnabledException` (400) unless `UserPoolAddOns.AdvancedSecurityMode` is enabled; the stored add-ons now gate the operation, before user resolution, and with add-ons enabled the answer stays an empty list since events are never recorded. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Aurora DSQL — the `ALTER TABLE` refusals answer what the service answers** — measured live (eu-central-1, 2026-08-30): a refused `ADD CONSTRAINT` drew three invented messages where DSQL answers one, `ADD COLUMN` accepted constraint clauses DSQL refuses, and `ALTER TABLE ASYNC ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` over violating rows failed at submit time where DSQL fails the job — `sys.jobs` now reports `failed` with the violation as `details`. Contributed by @vivedo.

## [1.5.3] — 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Step Functions — the JSONata query language** — a state machine declaring `QueryLanguage: JSONata` now evaluates its `{% ... %}` expressions through a full JSONata engine: `$states` and workflow variables bind as documented, the six Step Functions functions (`$partition`, `$range`, `$hash`, `$random`, `$uuid`, `$parse`) are registered, failures surface as `States.QueryEvaluationError` with the JSONata error code leading the cause (`T2010: ...`), a malformed expression is refused at `CreateStateMachine`/`UpdateStateMachine` with `InvalidDefinition` (`INVALID_JSONATA_EXPRESSION` naming the field's path) as AWS refuses it, a non-ISO `$toMillis` argument and a zero-length-matching `$replace` regex draw AWS's `D3110`/`D1004`, and evaluation carries AWS's 1-second timeout. `$eval` is absent, as on AWS. Reported by @facuparedes.
- **IoT Core — jobs delivered over MQTT** — the reserved `$aws/things/<t>/jobs/#` request topics (`get`, `start-next`, `<jobId>/get` including `$next`, `<jobId>/update`) answer on their `accepted`/`rejected` topics from the same store the HTTP plane uses, with `jobDocument` as a JSON object over MQTT (a string over HTTP, as on AWS) and rejections carrying the string `ErrorCode` values plus the execution's state on version and state-transition conflicts; `notify` fires when the pending set changes and `notify-next` only when the queue front changes. `stepTimeoutInMinutes` and `executionNumber` are accepted but ignored. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Core — provisioning templates, and `AWS::IoT::ProvisioningTemplate`** — `CreateProvisioningTemplate` and the four other template operations answered `Unsupported IoT path` and the CloudFormation type rolled back as unsupported; both now work with the wire shapes of the real service (`ResourceAlreadyExistsException` on duplicates, absent-not-empty `description`, 1-36 char names, a `templateBody` without an `AWS::IoT::Certificate` resource refused). Storage + CRUD only: the fleet-provisioning MQTT workflow is not implemented and versions are not modeled. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway — registered custom domains route the data plane** — a request addressed by a registered domain fell through host-pattern service guessing (typically into S3, or into IoT when the name contained `iot.`); it now resolves through the domain's base-path mappings before any guessing — longest base path wins, `"(none)"` is the root mapping, a mapping's stage is authoritative — matching the `BASE_PATH_MAPPING_ONLY` routing mode the records default to. Unregistered hosts are unchanged. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — in-place update handlers** — a stack update fell through to a destructive re-create for 106 of 132 registered types, wiping published Lambda versions, DynamoDB items, SQS messages and IAM attachments; `AWS::Lambda::Function`, `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`, the four API Gateway types, `AWS::IoT::TopicRule`, `AWS::SNS::Topic`, `AWS::SQS::Queue`, `AWS::Logs::LogGroup`, `AWS::S3::BucketPolicy`, `AWS::IAM::Role` and `AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy` now update in place through their service's own APIs, replacing only for genuinely create-only properties, as CloudFormation documents per property. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **S3 — replication delivers, with `x-amz-replication-status`** — a bucket's replication configuration was stored and echoed but never acted on: no object ever reached the destination and `HeadObject` showed no replication metadata. A write (put, POST upload, copy, or multipart complete) matching an Enabled rule's prefix now lands a copy in the destination bucket with its own version, the source's metadata, storage class override, and tags; the source object answers `ReplicationStatus: COMPLETED` (or `FAILED` when the destination is gone or no longer versioned) and the replica answers `REPLICA`, on current and version-addressed reads alike. The copy is synchronous so tests see a deterministic status. Delete-marker replication and replica re-replication are not modeled. Reported by @cringdahl.

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation — a resource that cannot be deleted fails the operation** — a missing delete handler was a log warning and `DeleteStack` reported `DELETE_COMPLETE` while resources lived on; the stack now lands `DELETE_FAILED` (failed resources retained for a retry, exports kept, deleted siblings gone) and a failed rollback lands `ROLLBACK_FAILED`/`UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED`, per the documented lifecycle. `AWS::Lambda::Version` gained a real delete handler (its `Ref` now returns the qualified version ARN, as on AWS) and `AWS::AppSync::GraphQLSchema` one that removes the stored schema. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Core — an HTTP shadow write publishes the reserved-topic notifications** — `UpdateThingShadow` over the REST data plane stored state and emitted nothing, so a topic rule on `.../shadow/update/accepted` fired for MQTT updates only; an accepted HTTP update now publishes `update/accepted`/`delta`/`documents` (and a delete its `delete/accepted`) through the same emission code as the MQTT bridge, which also fixed the `documents` envelope on both transports: it now echoes the request's `clientToken` and carries `state` + `metadata` + `version` only. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Core — device-plane job timestamps were milliseconds, 1000x off** — `iot-jobs-data` responses served epoch milliseconds where the API reference words every stamp "in seconds since the epoch"; every device-plane stamp, HTTP and MQTT alike, is now whole epoch seconds. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Step Functions — execution status changes are published to EventBridge** — real Step Functions automatically emits `source: aws.states` / `detail-type: "Step Functions Execution Status Change"` to the default bus whenever a standard execution changes status; MiniStack ran the execution and published nothing, so a rule matching those events never fired and applications waiting on them hung with no error anywhere. Every `StartExecution` now emits `RUNNING` and its completion `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED` (with `error`/`cause` and `REDRIVABLE`) or `ABORTED` on `StopExecution`, carrying the documented detail fields with epoch-millisecond dates; payloads over 248 KiB are excluded and flagged via `inputDetails`/`outputDetails`, and `StartSyncExecution` (the express-flavored path) emits nothing, as on AWS. Reported by @moonyseven.
- **ECS — a service's tasks register in its target groups** — a `loadBalancers` block was stored and never acted on, so `DescribeTargetHealth` stayed empty and every request through the load balancer fell to the listener's default action; a service now reconciles its target groups from its running tasks' addresses (awsvpc tasks carry their address as `attachments[].details[privateIPv4Address]`, where real ECS reports it), withdrawing only its own registrations so manually registered targets and a second service sharing the group survive, as on AWS. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **ECS — an `awsvpc` task no longer publishes host ports** — each `awsvpc` task has its own network namespace on AWS, so container ports never bind on the host; publishing them made two tasks sharing a container port collide with a Docker bind error that cannot happen on Fargate. Only `bridge` and `host` modes publish. Contributed by @jbschooley.
- **ELBv2 — a rule condition sent as a typed config is read** — only the flat legacy `Values` list was parsed, so a rule created by Terraform (which sends `PathPatternConfig`/`HostHeaderConfig`/`HttpRequestMethodConfig`/`SourceIpConfig`) stored an empty condition and never fired; both shapes now parse, `DescribeRules` echoes the typed config alongside `Values` as AWS does, and the data-plane matcher recognizes AWS's `http-request-method` field name. Contributed by @jbschooley.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-08-26

### Added
- **Cognito — `AdminLinkProviderForUser` / `AdminDisableProviderForUser`** — both actions answered `InvalidAction`, so a federated identity could not be linked to a local user. Linking records the identity in the user's `identities` attribute (up to 5 per user, `AliasExistsException` when the identity is already linked) and a hosted-UI federated sign-in resolves to the linked user; disabling removes the link, and with `ProviderName=Cognito` it deactivates the local user's password sign-in (`NotAuthorizedException`) while the profile stays. Reported by @rsimples.
- **Cognito — `AddCustomAttributes`, and a user pool that reports its schema (`SchemaAttributes`)** — `DescribeUserPool` never returned the pool's attribute schema and `AddCustomAttributes` answered `InvalidAction`, so Terraform re-planned an `aws_cognito_user_pool` as changed right after creating it and failed the follow-up apply. A pool now carries the full standard attribute set with AWS's data types, mutability and constraints, a request's `Schema` entries override a standard entry field-for-field under their `custom:`/`dev:` prefix, and `AddCustomAttributes` adds 1-25 attributes per call with the documented errors; a `Required` custom attribute is refused `InvalidParameterException`, as real Cognito refuses it. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **S3 — `ListBuckets` pagination (`MaxBuckets`, `ContinuationToken`, `Prefix`)** — every call returned the full bucket list and ignored the paging parameters; they are now honored, with `ContinuationToken` alone signalling a further page, per the S3 model. Contributed by @gaul.
- **S3 — `CRC32C` checksums** — a put carrying `x-amz-checksum-crc32c` was refused as unsupported; CRC32C is now computed in-process (table-driven, no new dependency), verified on upload (`BadDigest` on mismatch) and surfaced on reads with checksum mode enabled, completing all five S3 checksum algorithms. Contributed by @gaul.

### Fixed
- **Step Functions — `CreateStateMachine` is idempotent** — repeating a create with the same name refused `StateMachineAlreadyExists` even when the request was identical, which AWS answers with the existing machine's ARN. An identical create (definition, role, type, logging, publish and version description) now succeeds, only a differing one is refused, and `DescribeStateMachine` no longer leaks internal version-bookkeeping fields. Contributed by @bandle.
- **EventBridge — an input template no longer needs quotes around a string variable** — AWS adds the quotes itself when a string variable sits in a JSON value position, so the documented form `{"detail": <detail>, "groupId": <groupId>}` rendered a body that would not parse. A string variable in a value position is now quoted, a variable inside a string literal interpolates raw, and an object or array spliced into a string has its internal quotes stripped, as AWS does. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **EventBridge Pipes — a DynamoDB stream reaches a Step Functions target** — the poller delivered to SNS and to nothing else, so a pipe targeting a state machine reported `RUNNING`, advanced no position and moved no records, with no error and no log line. A `states` target now gets one `StartExecution` per batch carrying the records as a JSON array, and a batch that fails to reach its target stays on the stream for the next poll to retry, logging a warning naming the pipe. Contributed by @facuparedes.
- **EC2 — `DescribeSnapshots` evaluates `Filters`** — filters were ignored entirely, so every filtered call returned every snapshot in the account; the documented filter names (`snapshot-id`, `volume-id`, `status`, `owner-id`, `encrypted`, the `tag` forms, ...) now narrow the result. Contributed by @bandle.
- **EC2 — two invented operations removed** — `DescribeInstanceMaintenanceOptions` and `DescribeInstanceAutoRecoveryAttribute` do not exist in the EC2 API; both handlers answered invented shapes and are gone.
- **S3 — `CopyObject` applies `x-amz-acl`, and `UploadPartCopy` honors the copy-source conditions** — a canned ACL on a copy was dropped, so a copy addressed `public-read` landed private with no way to tell but reading the ACL back, and `UploadPartCopy` ignored all four `x-amz-copy-source-if-*` headers. A copy now permissions the destination as a put does (an unknown value refuses the request), a copy without an ACL leaves the destination private rather than inheriting the replaced key's, and both copy operations judge the source conditions the same way. Contributed by @gaul.
- **S3 — the versioning edges answer the way S3 answers them** — `DeleteBucket` deleted a bucket that still held versions or delete markers (now `BucketNotEmpty` until they are removed by version id); reading a delete marker by its version id answered 200-empty on GET and `NoSuchVersion` on HEAD (now `405 Method Not Allowed` with `x-amz-delete-marker`, `Last-Modified` and `Allow: DELETE`); an ACL or tag operation naming a version that never existed read back the default policy (now `NoSuchVersion`); and `ListObjectVersions` honors `delimiter`, grouping keys into `CommonPrefixes`. Contributed by @gaul.
- **S3 — the directory-bucket delete conditions are refused** — `x-amz-if-match-size` and `x-amz-if-match-last-modified-time` (and the `Size` / `LastModifiedTime` members in a `DeleteObjects` entry) were silently ignored on a general-purpose bucket; they now answer `NotImplemented`, as live S3 does. Reported by @gaul.
- **CodeBuild — `BatchDeleteBuilds` reports `buildsNotDeleted` as structures** — an id that could not be deleted was reported as a bare string where the API models `{id, statusCode}`, crashing SDK parsers; it now answers the documented structure.
- **Lambda — `InvokeWithResponseStream` returns an HTTP-level error unframed** — a `ResourceNotFoundException` (and any other non-200) was wrapped in the eventstream envelope, which SDK parsers cannot read; the error now returns as plain JSON, and only a 200 streams.
- **s3tables — the delete operations answer `204 No Content`** — `DeleteTableBucket`, `DeleteNamespace` and `DeleteTable` answered `200 {}` where AWS answers an empty 204.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-25

### Added
- **SNS — `GetPlatformApplicationAttributes` / `SetPlatformApplicationAttributes`** — both actions answered `400 InvalidAction`, so `terraform plan` on an `aws_sns_platform_application` failed at refresh. `Get` returns the attribute map, `Set` merges the supplied entries, with `InvalidParameter` (400) for a missing parameter and `NotFound` (404) for an unknown application; `CreatePlatformApplication` also seeds `Enabled=true`, as AWS reports for a new application. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **Step Functions — `States.StringSplit` and `States.Hash` intrinsics** — both raised `States.Runtime: Unsupported intrinsic function`, and splitting `$$.Execution.Id` on `:` is how a machine recovers its own region and account id. `StringSplit` treats every character of its second argument as a delimiter and keeps no empty member; `Hash` computes the five published algorithms as lowercase hex, shares the base64 intrinsics' 10,000-character cap, and refuses any other algorithm. Contributed by @bandle.
- **RDS — RDS Proxy (control plane)** — `CreateDBProxy` and the twelve other proxy operations answered `InvalidAction`, so an `aws_db_proxy` definition could not be applied at all. Proxies, endpoints, the default target group and registered targets now create, describe, modify and delete with the documented shapes, defaults, constraints and faults; creating a proxy also creates its default endpoint and `default` target group, as AWS does. Metadata only — nothing listens on the proxy hostname. Reported by @jmreicha.
- **EC2 — opt-in launch options for instance containers (`EC2_DOCKER_FLAGS`)** — an image that boots an operating system (systemd as PID 1) needs container options the fixed launch arguments cannot express. `EC2_DOCKER_FLAGS` takes a docker-CLI-style string (`--privileged`, `--cap-add`, `-e`, `-v`, ...) applied to every instance container; unset, nothing changes, and `--init` is refused. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Changed
- **Docker — the slim image ships the MySQL IAM auth plugins** — the plugins were compiled only into the `-full` flavor, so on the slim image Aurora MySQL IAM authentication silently disabled itself. The slim build now copies the plugin tree from the published full image, pinned to the release's digest so both flavors carry the same tree. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **IAM — a resource-scoped policy works for JSON-protocol services (`AUTH=true`)** — `extract_resource_arn` read SQS, ACM, SSM and CloudWatch parameters from the query form only, so for current SDKs the resource fell back to `*` and every queue-, certificate-, parameter- or alarm-scoped statement denied. The request body is now read too, and SQS also resolves a queue addressed by path. Reported by @rsimples.
- **IAM — `kms:Decrypt` resolves the key from the ciphertext (`AUTH=true`)** — `Decrypt` and `ReEncrypt` carry no `KeyId` for a symmetric key, so the resource fell back to `*` and a policy naming the key allowed `Encrypt` but denied `Decrypt`. The key id is now recovered from the ciphertext blob the same way the KMS handler recovers it. Reported by @rsimples.
- **Lambda — `CreateFunction` with an unresolvable role answers 400, not 500 (`AUTH=true`)** — the role check's error was swallowed inside config building, so the client got `500 InternalError` and a half-created record was left behind. The role is now validated before anything is stored, answering `400 InvalidParameterValueException`. Reported by @rsimples.
- **Cognito — group membership records the resolved Username** — `AdminAddUserToGroup` stored the caller-supplied name, which in a `UsernameAttributes = ["email"]` pool is an alias rather than the user key, so `ListUsersInGroup` dropped the member and `AdminRemoveUserFromGroup` never matched it. Both now key on the resolved Username. Contributed by @Lukasdoe.
- **Cognito — `AdminDeleteUser` deletes the user an email alias resolves to** — the delete was keyed on the caller-supplied name after resolving the alias, so it raised `KeyError`, answered `500 InternalError`, and the user survived; a delete-then-create seed failed `UsernameExistsException` on every run after the first. Contributed by @Lukasdoe.
- **S3 — a presigned upload no longer drops the `x-amz-*` headers it was signed with** — SigV4 lets a presigned URL hoist the operation's `x-amz-*` headers into the query string, and real S3 applies them as the headers they stand for; MiniStack only read headers, so a presigned `PutObject` stored the object without its metadata. Hoisted params are now folded back into the headers before routing, an explicitly sent header still winning. Contributed by @dennmart.
- **S3 — a supplied checksum is verified, however it arrives** — an `x-amz-checksum-*` value was only checked when the request also named `x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm`, so a mismatched value was stored unread and echoed on later reads as though verified, and a checksum sent as an `aws-chunked` trailer never arrived at all. Every supplied value is now recomputed (`BadDigest` on mismatch) and trailing headers are lifted into the request headers. Contributed by @gaul.
- **Step Functions — the `aws-sdk:cloudwatchlogs` integration routes** — Step Functions names CloudWatch Logs by its SDK service id, so the documented `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:cloudwatchlogs:createLogGroup` failed `States.Runtime` before dispatch; only the endpoint-prefix spelling `logs`, which AWS does not accept, was registered. The documented name now dispatches, takes PascalCase `Parameters`, and surfaces errors as `CloudWatchLogs.*`. Contributed by @bandle.
- **Glue — a Spark job's own SDK clients reach MiniStack** — only the S3A endpoint was configured, so a bare `boto3.client("s3")` in a job script escaped to real AWS and failed `InvalidAccessKeyId`. The container now carries `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, and because the Glue 4.0 image's botocore predates that variable, a bootstrap defaults every client's `endpoint_url` before running the script unchanged.
- **CloudFormation — `Fn::Sub` honors the `${!Literal}` escape** — the leading `!` was not recognized, so `${!Literal}` rendered as `!Literal` with the braces consumed and registered a false dependency; an `AWS::IoT::Policy` pinned to `${!iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}` deployed with a document matching nothing. It now renders as the literal `${Literal}`. Contributed by @maximoosemine. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **EventBridge — dotted pattern keys resolve to the nested path** — Event Ruler joins keys with `.`, so `{"detail.name": [...]}` and the nested spelling are the same rule on AWS, but the 1.4 matcher read a dotted key as one literal segment and such a rule silently matched nothing; dotted-form rules that delivered on 1.3.x stopped after upgrading. Pattern keys are now split on `.` when the compiler extends the path. Contributed by @prandogabriel.
- **IoT Core — an unresolvable action role fails `CreateTopicRule` instead of silently dropping the rule (`AUTH=true`)** — the role-check error was discarded and the API answered `200 {}` while storing nothing. `CreateTopicRule` / `ReplaceTopicRule` now answer `400 InvalidRequestException` (`Unable to assume role: {arn}`) as real IoT does, and the CloudFormation provisioner fails the resource. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — Aurora PostgreSQL major-version selectors return the matching catalog** — `DescribeDBEngineVersions` treated `EngineVersion=16` as an exact version and returned nothing; major-only selectors now return every advertised minor in that family, and `DefaultOnly=true` narrows to AWS's configured default minor for that major. Contributed by @jayjanssen.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-23

### Added
- **IAM — opt-in request authorization (`AUTH=true`)** — with `AUTH=true` MiniStack evaluates the caller's IAM policies before serving a request and answers `403 AccessDenied` (`User: {arn} is not authorized to perform: {action}`) when they do not allow it, across control-plane and data-plane paths (S3 object access, `execute-api:Invoke`, `lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl`, and per-service actions resolved from the botocore model). SigV4 signatures are still not validated — the access key only identifies the principal — so this is authorization, not authentication. Off by default (`AUTH=false`), leaving existing allow-all behavior unchanged.
- **Concurrency — a blocking handler no longer stalls concurrent requests** — the request-serving event loop is captured at startup and blocking service work runs on worker threads, with a helper that lets a worker thread re-enter an async handler safely; work is routed by whether it needs to call back into the server. Contributed by @Areson and @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFront — SaaS Manager (multi-tenant distributions)** — connection groups and distribution tenants provision with ETag / `If-Match` concurrency, per-tenant WAF association, tenant invalidations, and domain tooling. A tenant requires a `tenant-only` distribution (`InvalidAssociation`), CNAMEs are unique across tenants and distribution aliases (`CNAMEAlreadyExists`), deleting a distribution or connection group that still has tenants is refused (`ResourceInUse` / `CannotDeleteEntityWhileInUse`), and both families are taggable; async deploy, DNS and certificate workflows resolve immediately. Contributed by @mjdavidson.
- **EC2 — instances can have a real box behind them (`RegisterImage`)** — `RunInstances` returned a `running` record and booted nothing. `RegisterImage` now takes a container reference in `ImageLocation` and returns an `ami-` id whose launch boots that image as a container, its IP becoming the instance's address so `ssm:SendCommand` can report a real exit code. Such an AMI is `instance-store` backed (`StopInstances` / `StartInstances` answer `UnsupportedOperation`); registering is the only opt-in, so with nothing registered EC2 never reaches for Docker. `RebootInstances` also now rejects an unknown id with `InvalidInstanceID.NotFound` instead of returning `true` for any id. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **SSM — Run Command** — `SendCommand`, `GetCommandInvocation`, `ListCommands` and `DescribeInstanceInformation` returned `InvalidAction`. Invocations are now asynchronous as on AWS: `SendCommand` answers `Pending` and the caller polls to a terminal state, `AWS-RunShellScript` runs in the instance's container so `Status` reflects the real exit code, and an instance with no agent answering is refused `InvalidInstanceId`. Contributed by @bandle.
- **S3 — Glacier and Deep Archive restore (`RestoreObject`)** — an object in the `GLACIER` or `DEEP_ARCHIVE` storage class is now unreadable until restored: `GET`/`HEAD` is refused `403 InvalidObjectState`, `RestoreObject` runs an asynchronous restore, and `x-amz-restore` reports the ongoing request then the restored copy's expiry. `GLACIER_IR` stays readable and a `RestoreObject` against it fails `InvalidObjectState`, as on AWS. Reported by @mbenja086.

### Changed
- **Docker — the `full` image is smaller** — unused payload trimmed from the full variant. Reported by @areson.

### Fixed
- **IAM — a CloudFormation-provisioned policy no longer breaks the read APIs** — stack-created policies and attachments wrote shapes the IAM API never produced (`AttachedPolicies` as `{PolicyName, PolicyArn}` dicts, `Versions` as a list), so `GetAccountAuthorizationDetails`, `ListAttachedRolePolicies` and `ListPolicyVersions` errored or never matched. They now go through the IAM module, so one shape reaches every reader, `AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy` honours its `Roles` / `Users` / `Groups`, and both resource types return the `Fn::GetAtt` attributes CloudFormation documents. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — Node.js ESM handlers using top-level `await` load correctly** — a handler whose module graph contains a top-level `await` throws Node's `ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`, which fell through to an uncaught `RuntimeError`; both Node bootstraps now treat it like `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` and fall back to dynamic `import()`. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **Cognito — `ListUsers` `Filter` matches values case-insensitively** — every comparison was an exact string match, so `email = "user@example.com"` missed a profile stored as `User@Example.com`. Values are now matched case-insensitively for `email`, `phone_number`, `name`, `sub` and the other profile attributes, while `username` and `status` stay case-sensitive per the API reference. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **DynamoDB — an `UpdateExpression` alias is resolved before the key-attribute check** — `set #pk = :pk` with `#pk` mapped to a non-key attribute was wrongly refused with `Cannot update attribute pk. This attribute is part of the key`; the check now reads the alias-resolved roots, so only a path that resolves to the partition or sort key is rejected. Contributed by @ppettitau.
- **RDS — `DescribeDBInstances` honors SDK `Filters`** — clients serialize filters as `Filters.Filter.N` with `Values.Value.N`, but only the internal `Filters.member.N` form was parsed, so filters such as `db-cluster-id` were ignored. Both wire forms are now parsed. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **S3 — a conditional delete of a key with no current object answers 404** — `DeleteObject` with `If-Match` returned 204 for a key that was absent or hidden by a delete marker, so a compare-and-swap delete reported success it never did. The condition is now evaluated against the current version only: no current object answers `NoSuchKey`, a differing ETag `PreconditionFailed`, and a matching ETag or `If-Match: *` deletes. Reverted and fixed from 1.4.21.
- **S3 — one canonical owner ID across every S3 API** — `ListBuckets`, `GetBucketAcl`, `GetObjectAcl` and object listings returned the account id (or a placeholder) and disagreed with one another; they now return a single stable opaque 64-character hex canonical ID, as real S3 does. Reported by @jin-gizmo.
- **EC2 — `DescribeAvailabilityZones` reports the zone-group fields** — each zone was missing `groupName`, `networkBorderGroup` and `optInStatus`, so a consumer that reads them (Terraform's `aws_availability_zones` data source) saw them absent; standard zones now report them with an `opt-in-not-required` status.

## [1.4.21] — 2026-08-20

### Added
- **IoT Core — native mTLS MQTT listener on port 8883** — the embedded broker now also accepts MQTT over TLS on 8883 (`IOT_MTLS_ENABLED=0` turns it off, `IOT_MTLS_PORT` moves it), on by default when `cryptography` is present, so AWS IoT Device SDK binaries can connect. The broker certificate comes from the local CA (`GET /_ministack/iot/ca.pem`); a client certificate is optional (none is served under `MINISTACK_ACCOUNT_ID`, like an unsigned WebSocket upgrade) and an unknown or non-`ACTIVE` certificate is refused with a `0x05` CONNACK. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — replicated Aurora PostgreSQL readers survive StopDBCluster / StartDBCluster and warm boot** — under `MINISTACK_RDS_PG_CLUSTER_REPLICATION`, `StopDBCluster` now stops the reader containers alongside the writer and `StartDBCluster` revives each reader by re-cloning from the writer; the same revival runs on warm boot, so a persisted reader comes back as a real hot standby instead of being demoted to a writer alias. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::SES::ConfigurationSet` and `AWS::SES::ConfigurationSetEventDestination`** — a template carrying an SES configuration set no longer fails with "Unsupported resource type"; both resource types provision (registered in the classic and v2 SES stores, `Ref` returns the set name, the event destination round-trips), CloudFormation-provisioning fidelity only. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.

### Fixed
- **API Gateway (REST) — routing is on the resource+method pair, not the resource alone** — a request a matched resource does not serve (a methodless intermediate node, a CORS-preflight-only node, or an undeclared verb) now falls through to a `{proxy+}` elsewhere in the tree as it does on AWS; only an exact resource+method match keeps the request, and routing precedes authorization. Supersedes the 1.4.16 change that answered a methodless resource `403`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Step Functions — an unimplemented optimized service integration fails instead of silently succeeding** — a Task using an `arn:aws:states:::<service>:<action>` integration MiniStack does not implement fell through to echoing its input back as `SUCCEEDED`; it now fails with `States.Runtime` naming the unimplemented resource. Reported by @iwasakar.
- **CloudFormation — a replacement of a custom-named resource is refused instead of destroying data** — an update requiring replacement of a resource with an explicit physical name (for example changing a DynamoDB key attribute's type on a table that sets `TableName`) now fails and rolls back to `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` with `CloudFormation cannot update a stack when a custom-named resource requires replacing. Rename <name> and update the stack again.`, leaving the resource and its data intact. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — change sets report a valid status, fail when execution fails, and do not outlive their stack** — `ExecuteChangeSet` wrote the invalid `EXECUTE_COMPLETE` into `Status`, breaking the CDK's `Status == CREATE_COMPLETE` gate. `Status` now stays `CREATE_COMPLETE` while `ExecutionStatus` moves to `EXECUTE_COMPLETE` or `EXECUTE_FAILED` on the deployment outcome. A no-change set ends `FAILED`, a missing set returns `ChangeSetNotFound` (404), a duplicate name is `AlreadyExistsException`, deleting a stack removes its change sets, executing one deletes the others, and a direct `UpdateStack` marks pending sets `OBSOLETE`. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — Aurora engine versions are validated on non-create writes and global inheritance** — `ModifyDBInstance`, `ModifyDBCluster`, `CreateGlobalCluster`, `ModifyGlobalCluster`, and global-inherited `CreateDBCluster` now reject engine versions the catalog does not advertise; modify paths return `InvalidParameterCombination` / `Cannot find upgrade target from {current} with requested version {requested}.`, `ModifyGlobalCluster` propagates an accepted version to every member, and a member moved to a different major than its global is refused. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **RDS — global Aurora stop/start preserves topology and MySQL replication** — `StopDBCluster` and `StartDBCluster` are now limited to sole-member global databases (`InvalidDBClusterStateFault`, 400), deleting a primary's last instance preserves compute other global members still need, and a successful recreate resets stale MySQL replica state before re-linking replication. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **S3 — a conditional delete of an absent key is answered correctly** — `DeleteObject` with `If-Match` on a key that is not there now returns `204` (deleting an already-gone key is done), and `If-Match: *` is honored as an existence check — it holds against any present object and returns `412 PreconditionFailed` when the key is absent — rather than being compared as a literal ETag. Contributed by @gaul.
- **S3 — multipart uploads carry their parts' checksums through to a composite** — `CreateMultipartUpload` records the checksum algorithm, `UploadPart` validates and echoes each part's checksum, and completion builds the AWS composite (`<digest>-<parts>`, the digest of the parts' digests) read back through `ChecksumMode` as `COMPOSITE`; a mismatch is `BadDigest`. Contributed by @gaul.

## [1.4.20] — 2026-08-19

### Added
- **RDS — `FailoverDBCluster`** — forcing an Aurora failover was `InvalidAction`; it now promotes a reader to writer (explicit `TargetDBInstanceIdentifier` or the lowest `PromotionTier`), reporting the transitional `failing-over` status and flipped `IsClusterWriter` flags. Metadata-only until per-instance replication lands. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **RDS — opt-in Aurora PostgreSQL reader replication** — with `MINISTACK_RDS_PG_CLUSTER_REPLICATION=1`, extra cluster members run their own PostgreSQL containers, cloned with `pg_basebackup` and streaming WAL as hot standbys (read-only, `ReaderEndpoint` resolves to a reader). Off by default; Aurora MySQL and the no-flag path keep aliasing the writer's shared container. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **CloudFormation — API Gateway (v1) API keys and usage plans** — `AWS::ApiGateway::ApiKey`, `UsagePlan` and `UsagePlanKey` failed with `Unsupported resource type`; they now provision through the runtime stores with `Ref` and `Fn::GetAtt` wired, unblocking CDK `RestApi`/`ApiKey` and Terraform `aws_api_gateway_api_key`. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **AWS IoT Jobs — control plane and device data plane** — `CreateJob` fell through to `Unsupported IoT path` and `iot-jobs-data` did not exist; the `iot` service now serves the nine job operations and a new `iot-jobs-data` service the device ones, sharing one store and the AWS execution state machine. Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Fixed
- **S3 — server-side encryption is stated, validated, and enforced** — SSE-S3, SSE-KMS and SSE-C headers were accepted and forgotten. SSE is now contract state: validated on write, echoed on HEAD/GET, and enforced for SSE-C (keyless/plain read 400 `InvalidRequest`, wrong-key read 403 `AccessDenied`), following versions, copies and multipart completes. Contributed by @gaul.
- **DynamoDB — key attribute types are enforced on `PutItem`, `Query`, and `UpdateTable`** — a key declared `S` accepted an `N` value on write and in a key condition, and an attribute-definitions-only `UpdateTable` changed a key's type in place; all three now return `ValidationException`, so no API changes a key's type. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudWatch — extended-statistic percentiles are computed instead of aliased to `Average`** — `GetMetricData` and alarm evaluation now interpolate `pNN` from the period's samples on both paths, and a percentile alarm's `StateReason` reports the actual statistic (e.g. `p95`). Contributed by @MGSousa.
- **S3 — presigned SigV4 URLs verify for virtual-hosted addressing and temporary credentials** — a virtual-hosted URL was rewritten to path-style before its signature was recomputed, and an STS-signed URL was checked against the static secret; verification now runs against the original signed URI and the secret STS issued. Reported by @mayankgupta57.
- **Step Functions — `arn:aws:states:::events:putEvents` actually publishes the event** — the optimized EventBridge integration fell through to the task passthrough, so the state reported `SUCCEEDED` while nothing reached any target; it now calls EventBridge `PutEvents` and returns its response. Reported by @iwasakar.
- **S3 — SSE-C is enforced and echoed on `UploadPartCopy` and `CompleteMultipartUpload`** — `UploadPartCopy` accepted a part for an SSE-C upload without the upload's key and read an SSE-C copy source without the source key, and neither echoed the stored encryption; `UploadPartCopy` now requires both keys (including a `?versionId=`-qualified source) and echoes `SSECustomerAlgorithm`/`SSECustomerKeyMD5`, and `CompleteMultipartUpload` echoes `ServerSideEncryption`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Aurora DSQL — `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` is gated on lock strength, not the predicate** — strict mode rejected a locking read unless it was a single table with an equality on every key column (`0A000`), failing quoted identifiers from every mainstream ORM. Measured against a live cluster, `FOR UPDATE` now locks whatever the query selects, while `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`/`FOR SHARE`/`FOR KEY SHARE` are refused with `0A000`. Contributed by @vivedo.
- **Aurora DSQL — quoted identifiers are normalized the way the server stores them** — `DROP COLUMN "ID"` and mixed-case or schema-qualified table names were mis-resolved; identifiers are now folded as PostgreSQL folds them (bare lower-cased, quoted verbatim) and the relation requoted part by part before lookup. Contributed by @vivedo.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::IoT::Policy` updates apply instead of rolling the stack back** — the type had no update handler, so an edit hit `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` and rolled back. A changed `PolicyDocument` is now a no-interruption update stored as a new default version (pruned to IoT's five-version cap), and a changed `PolicyName` is a replacement. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **EC2 — instance public IP and DNS reach the SDKs** — `DescribeInstances`/`RunInstances` emitted the address under `publicIpAddress`/`publicDnsName` rather than the wire tags `ipAddress`/`dnsName`, so every SDK dropped both; they now ride the real tags, and generated addresses complete to four octets. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **S3 — versioning edge cases: the null version, delete markers, and versioned copies** — suspended-bucket PUT/DELETE store under the literal `null` version, pre-versioning objects stay addressable as `VersionId=null`, `DeleteObjects` mints markers (`x-amz-delete-marker: true` on the hidden 404), and `UploadPartCopy`/`CopyObject` honor the source `?versionId=`. Contributed by @gaul.
- **S3 — `CompleteMultipartUpload` honors `If-Match` / `If-None-Match`** — conditional writes landed on PutObject but were ignored on the multipart path, so a create-once or compare-and-swap upload could silently overwrite; the complete now evaluates the same preconditions (412 on violation, 404 `NoSuchKey` for `If-Match` on a missing object). Contributed by @gaul.
- **S3 — canned ACLs are stored, and object ACLs bind to versions** — `PutBucketAcl`/`CreateBucket` dropped the `x-amz-acl` header SDKs send, so buckets read back owner-only; both now validate and store the canned grants (`InvalidArgument`/`MalformedACLError`/`MissingSecurityHeader` as on AWS), and object ACLs are per-version like tags. Contributed by @gaul.
- **S3 — `CRC64NVME` checksums are computed instead of refused** — the default SDK/CLI checksum algorithm returned `InvalidRequest`, so a stock `aws s3 cp` failed; it is now computed from a stdlib table (no new dependency), validated on upload (`BadDigest` on mismatch) and returned on GET/HEAD. `CRC32C` still needs its native library. Contributed by @gaul.
- **CloudFormation — auto-generated physical names keep their uniqueness suffix when truncated** — a deeply-nested stack whose generated name exceeded a resource's name cap truncated every resource to the same string and collapsed them onto one; the hash suffix that guarantees uniqueness is now always preserved. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **IAM — role `Description` charset is validated** — `CreateRole`, `UpdateRole` and `UpdateRoleDescription` now reject a description outside IAM's allowed character set or longer than 1000 characters with `400 ValidationError`. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::SSM::Parameter` goes through the SSM API** — instead of writing the store directly, so a create over an existing name fails (`ParameterAlreadyExists`), updates increment `Version`, a `Name` change replaces, `SecureString` is rejected, and `Fn::GetAtt` exposes `Arn`/`Type`/`Value`. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<...>` is re-resolved on `UpdateStack`** — the parameter name is kept and re-resolved on every operation, so an update with `UsePreviousValue=true` picks up a value changed in Parameter Store since the last deploy. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — Aurora engine versions are validated on non-create writes and global inheritance** — `ModifyDBCluster`, `CreateGlobalCluster`, and `ModifyGlobalCluster` stored arbitrary Aurora engine versions that the shared engine catalog did not advertise, and `CreateDBCluster` could inherit such a version from legacy global-cluster state even though supplying it explicitly was rejected. All four paths now use the create-time shared catalog validator and reject unknown versions with `InvalidParameterCombination` / `Cannot find version {version} for {engine}` before mutating state. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **EC2 — instance public IP and DNS reach the SDKs, and generated addresses are addresses** — `DescribeInstances` and `RunInstances` emitted the public address under `publicIpAddress` / `publicDnsName`, which are not the tags the EC2 wire schema defines (`ipAddress` / `dnsName`, per botocore's `ec2-2016-11-15` model), so every SDK dropped both fields silently and `PublicIpAddress` came back absent on instances that had one. They now ride the real tags. Fixing that exposed a second one: `_random_ip` appended two octets whatever it was given, so a one-octet prefix produced `52.55.218` — `AllocateAddress` has been handing back that shape as `PublicIp` all along, and no address parser accepts it. The generator now completes any prefix to four octets. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **S3 — `CRC64NVME` checksums are computed instead of refused** — CRC-64/NVME is the algorithm current AWS SDKs and the CLI checksum uploads with by default, and MiniStack answered it with `InvalidRequest` ("requires optional native dependencies"), so a stock `aws s3 cp` or `aws s3api put-object` failed before it began unless the caller knew to set `AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION=when_required`. The algorithm is plain arithmetic — the reflected form of polynomial `0xAD93D23594C93659` with all-ones init and xorout — so it is now computed from a byte-at-a-time table in the stdlib, adding no dependency: `PutObject` and `CopyObject` validate a client-supplied `x-amz-checksum-crc64nvme` (`BadDigest` on mismatch) and `GetObject` / `HeadObject` return it under `x-amz-checksum-mode: ENABLED`, typed `FULL_OBJECT`. The tests pin the implementation to the algorithm's published check value (`b"123456789"` → `0xAE8B14860A799888`) and to a bit-at-a-time reference rather than to itself. `CRC32C` still requires the native `google-crc32c` and is still refused.
## [1.4.19] — 2026-08-16

### Added
- **IoT Core — device shadows over MQTT** — the classic and named device-shadow operations are now served over the broker at the AWS reserved topics. Publishing to `$aws/things/<thing>/shadow[/name/<name>]/{get,update,delete}` drives the same shadow store the HTTP data plane uses and replies on the matching `accepted` / `rejected` topics; an `update` also publishes `delta` (when `desired` and `reported` differ) and `documents` (with `previous`/`current`, delta stripped). Malformed JSON is rejected on the verb's `rejected` topic, and every response echoes the request's `clientToken`, as on AWS. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Core — `sqs` topic-rule action** — a rule carrying `{"sqs": {"queueUrl", "roleArn", "useBase64"}}` was stored and then dispatched nothing. The payload now goes through SQS's own `SendMessage`, so the queue's `DelaySeconds` and size limit apply; `useBase64` Base64-encodes the body as on AWS; an unresolvable queue fails that action alone and reaches the rule's `errorAction`; FIFO destinations are refused, which AWS does not support for this action. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Core — CA-certificate registry and just-in-time-registration events** — `GetRegistrationCode`, `DeleteRegistrationCode`, `RegisterCACertificate` (`setAsActive` / `allowAutoRegistration` as query parameters), `DescribeCACertificate`, `UpdateCACertificate`, `ListCACertificates` and `DeleteCACertificate` are served. Deleting an ACTIVE CA is refused with `CertificateStateException` (406), a duplicate CA is `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` (409), and `RegisterCertificate` validates `caCertificatePem` against the registered, actually-signing CA before storing anything, answering `CertificateValidationException` (400) otherwise. Registering a device certificate under an ACTIVE auto-registration CA publishes the JITR lifecycle event to `$aws/events/certificates/registered/{caCertificateId}`. Deleting an ACTIVE device certificate now answers the modeled `CertificateStateException` (406) instead of a generic 409. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Core — MQTT 5.0 negotiated per connection** — the broker negotiates its wire format from the CONNECT packet's protocol level: a 5.0 client receives property blocks, subscription options and reason codes on CONNACK/SUBACK/PUBACK/UNSUBACK/DISCONNECT, a 3.1.1 client keeps getting the exact bytes it did before, and a message crosses between the two versions. The CONNACK advertises AWS's server capabilities — `Maximum QoS` 1 (no QoS 2), `Maximum Packet Size` 128 KB, `Retain Available`, wildcard subscriptions — and features the broker does not implement (topic aliases, shared subscriptions, subscription identifiers) are advertised as unavailable rather than left silent. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Core — `connectivity.*` terms in the fleet index** — with `thingConnectivityIndexingMode: STATUS` in the indexing configuration, `SearchIndex` answers `connectivity.connected`, `connectivity.timestamp` and `connectivity.disconnectReason`, every hit carries the `connectivity` group, and `DescribeIndex`'s schema reports `..._AND_CONNECTIVITY_STATUS`. `connected` is derived from the live session registry — a thing is connected while a session whose client id equals the thing name is live — so it cannot drift or survive a restart, and the disconnect reason is one of `CLIENT_INITIATED_DISCONNECT`, `DUPLICATE_CLIENTID` or `CONNECTION_LOST` (the reasons the broker can distinguish). Contributed by @iot-rocket.

### Fixed
- **EventBridge — event-pattern matching follows AWS** — the matcher was rewritten to AWS's real semantics. A pattern whose only key is `$or`, or whose keys are all unrecognized envelope fields, no longer matches every event; `$or` is expanded with AWS's last-write-wins on a repeated field and its 1000-rule-combination cap; `wildcard` treats only `*` as special, with `\` escaping and consecutive `*` refused; `exists` works on leaf nodes; `resources` is an OR; and `cidr`, `equals-ignore-case`, and case-insensitive `prefix`/`suffix` are evaluated. An unparseable pattern is rejected with `InvalidEventPatternException` at `PutRule`, `TestEventPattern`, `CreateArchive` and `UpdateArchive`. Contributed by @t-rech.
- **Cognito — federation endpoints are built from the user pool's domain, and `CustomDomainConfig` is honored** — `CreateUserPoolDomain` accepted `CustomDomainConfig` and discarded it, always expanding `Domain` to `{Domain}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com`, while the SAML ACS URL and the OIDC federation callback ignored the domain entirely and were built from `MINISTACK_HOST`/`GATEWAY_PORT`. Federated sign-in therefore handed external identity providers `redirect_uri=http://localhost:4566/oauth2/idpresponse` — an address the browser cannot reach and that Google and other public IdPs reject outright for the scheme alone — so the flow died at the hop to the IdP with no way to correct it. `CustomDomainConfig` now distinguishes a custom domain (a full FQDN, served as-is and reported as `CustomDomain` on `DescribeUserPool`, fronted by a CloudFront distribution) from a prefix domain (a bare label, still expanded to the regional host), and `/saml2/idpresponse` and `/oauth2/idpresponse` — including the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` in the generated SAML `AuthnRequest` and the `redirect_uri` replayed on the back-channel token exchange — are derived from whichever the pool has, exactly as AWS derives them. Configuring a custom domain is the same `create-user-pool-domain --custom-domain-config CertificateArn=...` call you would make against AWS; the certificate is recorded, not served, since TLS for a custom domain is terminated by whatever fronts it (nginx, an ALB, CloudFront) and proxied to the gateway. A pool holds one domain of each kind independently, a `CustomDomainConfig` without a `CertificateArn` is a `InvalidParameterException`, and a pool with no domain still falls back to the local gateway, so existing setups are unchanged. Contributed by @tema-mazy.
- **DynamoDB — enabling a stream through `UpdateTable` sets the stream ARN** — `UpdateTable` with `StreamSpecification.StreamEnabled=true` stored the specification but left `LatestStreamArn` and `LatestStreamLabel` unset, so `aws_dynamodb_table.stream_arn` came back empty in Terraform. Enabling a stream on the disabled→enabled transition now mints the label and `arn:aws:dynamodb:<region>:<account>:table/<name>/stream/<label>`, exactly as `CreateTable` already does, and `DescribeStream` resolves the new ARN. Contributed by @nightcityblade. Reported by @wparad.
- **Lambda — the 250 MB unzipped limit counts function code plus layers** — the unzipped-size check was applied to the deployment package on its own, so a function whose code and attached layers exceeded 250 MB together (each under the limit individually) was accepted, unlike AWS. `CreateFunction` and `UpdateFunctionCode` now sum the function code and every attached layer, unzipped, and reject a total over 262144000 bytes with `InvalidParameterValueException`, matching AWS's quota — "the maximum size of the contents of a deployment package, including layers and custom runtimes". Publishing a single oversized layer is still refused on its own. Reported by @iot-rocket.

## [1.4.18] — 2026-08-16

### Added
- **SES v2 — email template CRUD and `SendEmail` with `Content.Template`** — the v2 `SendEmail` handler read only `Content.Simple` and `Content.Raw`, so a templated send was accepted with a `200` and a `MessageId` while the template was silently dropped, delivering an empty subject and body. `Content.Template` is now rendered through the same `{{placeholder}}` substitution v1 uses, from a stored template or from `TemplateContent` supplied inline, and a named template that doesn't exist fails the send with `NotFoundException` instead of delivering an empty email. `CreateEmailTemplate`, `GetEmailTemplate`, `UpdateEmailTemplate`, `DeleteEmailTemplate`, and `ListEmailTemplates` are served at `/v2/email/templates[/{TemplateName}]` over the shared v1 store, so a template created with `aws ses create-template` is sendable through `aws sesv2 send-email`. `ListEmailTemplates` paginates: `PageSize` accepts the documented 1–100 and defaults to 10, with an opaque `NextToken` returned only while further templates remain. Contributed by @mikolajk0wal.
- **IoT Core — fleet indexing** — `SearchIndex` (`POST /indices/search`) and the indexing-configuration operations (`UpdateIndexingConfiguration` / `GetIndexingConfiguration` / `DescribeIndex` / `ListIndices`) were unimplemented. The `AWS_Things` index is `OFF` by default; enabling it with `UpdateIndexingConfiguration` (as Terraform's `aws_iot_indexing_configuration` does) lets `SearchIndex` answer `AND`-separated `thingName` / `thingTypeName` / `thingGroupNames` / `attributes.*` / `shadow.desired|reported.*` terms — `*`/`?` wildcards, numeric shadow compare, `maxResults`/`nextToken` paging with the documented ceiling of 100 — queried directly against the live registry and classic shadows. Searching while `thingIndexingMode` is `OFF` returns `ResourceNotFoundException`, and `REGISTRY` vs `REGISTRY_AND_SHADOW` gates the shadow terms. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT Core — `RegisterCertificateWithoutCA` and the deprecated principal-policy operations** — `RegisterCertificateWithoutCA` (`POST /certificate/register-no-ca`) shares the `RegisterCertificate` store, returning `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` with `resourceId`/`resourceArn` on a duplicate PEM. The deprecated `AttachPrincipalPolicy` / `DetachPrincipalPolicy` / `ListPrincipalPolicies` / `ListPolicyPrincipals` map onto the modern policy-target store, with the principal in the `x-amzn-iot-principal` header and the policy name in `x-amzn-iot-policy`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — Aurora MySQL compatibility objects** — Aurora MySQL provisioning that creates users with `AWSAuthenticationPlugin` and calls RDS-specific stored procedures failed against upstream MySQL images. MiniStack now builds ABI-matched MySQL 8.0/8.4 `AWSAuthenticationPlugin` artifacts (amd64/arm64), installs a reject-all compatibility plugin without changing password authentication, and adds the Aurora/RDS procedures, configuration surface, and predefined S3 roles those workflows expect. The path is automatic for supported MySQL images and can be disabled with `MINISTACK_MYSQL_IAM_AUTH=off`; the plugin deliberately rejects authentication, so the existing non-enforcement stance is unchanged. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **Request headers — a field repeated across lines is no longer reduced to its last line** — the ASGI header dict was built with plain assignment, so when a client sent the same field twice the earlier line was discarded. The AWS SDK for Java v2 uploads exactly that way, emitting `Content-Encoding: gzip` and `Content-Encoding: aws-chunked` as separate lines: MiniStack saw only `aws-chunked`, stripped it as the chunk-framing marker it is, and stored the object with no content encoding at all — silently losing `gzip` for every Java SDK v2 caller, S3Proxy's `aws-s3` backend among them. Repeated field lines now combine into one comma-joined value as RFC 9110 5.2 requires (`Cookie` rejoins with `"; "` per RFC 9113 8.2.3), so `aws-chunked` is stripped from the joined list and the caller's encoding survives. Sending the header once, in either order, was already correct and is unchanged. Contributed by @gaul.
- **SES v2 — error responses carry `x-amzn-errortype`** — restJson1 resolves the error shape from that header, so without it SDKs surfaced a bare HTTP status instead of the modelled exception: boto3 reported `An error occurred (404)` rather than `NotFoundException`, and typed handling never matched on any SESv2 operation. The 1.3.24 sweep that added the header centrally in `error_response_json` reached `ses` but not `ses_v2`, which builds its error bodies itself; it is now set on all of them. Contributed by @mikolajk0wal.
- **API Gateway — non-proxy (`AWS`) Lambda integrations return the handler's raw output** — `AWS` and `AWS_PROXY` shared one response path, so a custom-integration handler returning a plain document had it read as a `{statusCode, headers, body}` proxy envelope: a `statusCode` key in the data became the HTTP status and the rest was dropped. A non-proxy integration now serializes the return value as the response body with the integration response's status (200 by default); a standard Lambda error is passed through as the body at the default 200 status (as AWS does when no `selectionPattern` is configured), and an uninvokable or throttled backend is a `504` integration failure. `AWS_PROXY` is unchanged. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT — topic-rule `WHERE` evaluation, SQL functions, and non-Lambda actions** — rules ignored the `WHERE` clause, so every publish matching the topic filter dispatched, and Lambda was the only action wired up. The rules engine now evaluates `WHERE` with AWS's three-valued (Undefined) logic — `=`/`<>`/`<`/`>`/`BETWEEN`/`IN`/`LIKE`/`IS NULL`/`regexp_matches`, `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`, and arithmetic — implements the `clientid` / `encode` / `isundefined` / `newuuid` / `regexp_matches` / `replace` / `timestamp` / `topic` functions (an unimplemented function resolves to Undefined and warns once), and dispatches the `republish`, `dynamoDBv2`, and `sns` actions, running the rule's `errorAction` on a delivery failure. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway (REST / v1) — Lambda authorizer cache is scoped to the method ARN and stage** — the cache stored the allow/deny decision keyed on the identity source alone, so a cached `Allow` for `GET /alpha` also authorized `GET /beta`, and a verdict cached on one stage was served for another. It now caches the authorizer's policy document and re-evaluates it against each request's own method ARN, with the stage and API in the key; malformed authorizer output (missing `policyDocument` or `principalId`) answers `500` and is never cached. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway (HTTP API / v2) — REQUEST-authorizer cache is scoped to the route ARN** — the v2 cache stored the verdict rather than the authorizer's response, so a cached `Allow` leaked across routes. It now caches the output (the policy document for an IAM-policy response, the `isAuthorized` boolean for a simple response) and re-evaluates the policy against each request's own route ARN, keyed on the identity source values and stage; caching requires at least one identity source and the cache is bounded. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — a Docker-executor handler's callbacks resolve on native Linux engines** — `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` inside a Lambda container is rewritten to `host.docker.internal`, which only resolves on Docker Desktop, so on a native Linux engine every nested SDK call a handler made died on DNS. Lambda containers now map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` (as the ECS and EKS paths already do); an explicit `--add-host` still wins. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT — MQTT `UNSUBSCRIBE` removes only the topic filters it names** — the MQTT-over-WebSocket bridge never read the filter list in the packet and unsubscribed every subscription the session held, so a client unsubscribing from one topic stopped receiving all the others. It now removes only the named filters (matched character-by-character per MQTT 3.1.1 §3.10.4, so a wildcard matches its own text), popping the id from every per-session map so a preserved `cleanSession=0` session cannot resurrect a removed filter, and a truncated payload unsubscribes what parsed rather than tearing the session down. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **TLS — minted leaf certificates carry an Authority Key Identifier** — `sign_leaf_certificate` omitted it, and RFC 5280 requires it on every certificate that is not self-issued. Python 3.13 enables `ssl.VERIFY_X509_STRICT` in `ssl.create_default_context()`, so any client on a current Python rejected what MiniStack minted with "Missing Authority Key Identifier" — `CreateKeysAndCertificate` certificates included. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda (Docker executor) — a failed init or a timed-out handler is reported once, not retried** — the RIE invoke loop's single connection-retry arm swallowed two terminal cases that both look like `OSError`: a failed `INIT` (RIE answers `502`, raised as `HTTPError`) and a read timeout (bare `TimeoutError`). A function whose module fails to import re-ran `INIT` ~10×/second up to its `Timeout` — a 900-second function pinned the emulator ~15 minutes — and the caller got a generic error instead of the real `Runtime.ImportModuleError`. Both are now terminal: an init failure returns `200` with `X-Amz-Function-Error: Unhandled` and the runtime's own error payload, a timeout answers `Runtime.ExitError` and recycles the container, and only genuine connection failures still retry within a bounded cold-start window. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Lambda — `RecursiveLoop` is enforced** — `PutFunctionRecursionConfig` stored the setting and nothing read it, so a self-invoking function looped unchecked (an async self-invoke returns `202`, releases its worker, and never throttles). A per-request lineage depth now travels with direct Lambda → Lambda invocations; past ~16 hops the invocation is dropped with `RecursiveInvocationException` and a `RecursiveInvocationsDropped` metric, unless the function's `RecursiveLoop` is `Allow`. Loops that leave through SQS, SNS or S3 and back are not yet detected. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Aurora DSQL — index and DDL error parity, including expression index keys** — the wire proxy now allows expression index keys on `CREATE INDEX ASYNC` (a volatile function is rejected `42P17: functions in index expression must be marked IMMUTABLE`, an expression in an `INCLUDE` column `0A000`) and aligns the surrounding errors with a live cluster: plain `CREATE INDEX` is always refused (`unsupported mode. please use CREATE INDEX ASYNC.`), `USING` / `CONCURRENTLY` / `WHERE` return DSQL's own messages, 9+ key columns `54011`, a nameless `IF NOT EXISTS` `42601`, and a primary-key column drop reports `cannot drop primary key column <name>`. Contributed by @ry-allan.
- **ALB — target responses are streamed instead of buffered** — the data plane read a target's entire response before returning, so a streaming or chunked target reached the client only once it had finished producing (measured time-to-first-byte for a 700 KB stream: 11.28s → 0.004s). It now relays the body as the target produces it, keeping the target's framing (`Content-Length` or chunked) and bounding an established connection by an idle timeout (default 60s) distinct from the 10s connect deadline; a target that dies mid-body surfaces as a truncated response rather than a clean one. Contributed by @uttom-akash.
- **S3 — GetObject and HeadObject answer the conditional-read headers** — `If-Match`, `If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since` and `If-Unmodified-Since` were honoured on PutObject, CopyObject and DeleteObject but ignored on the reads, so every conditional read returned `200` and the whole body: a cache revalidating an unchanged object refetched it in full, and a read guarded against a concurrent overwrite never noticed one. Reads now answer `412 PreconditionFailed` or `304 Not Modified`, with the precedence RFC 9110 13.2.2 and the AWS GetObject reference define — an entity tag decides, and its date counterpart applies only in its absence — and a `412` preempts a `Range` rather than slicing a representation the caller rejected. The `304` keeps the validators (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`) and drops the headers describing a payload it cannot carry, `x-amz-checksum-*` included, which boto3 asks for by default and would otherwise try to validate against the empty body. Reported by @gaul.

## [1.4.17] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Lambda::LayerVersionPermission`** — a stack that grants layer access (serverless-python-requirements `allowedAccounts`, CDK `addPermission`) failed with `Unsupported resource type` and rolled back. The type now calls AddLayerVersionPermission, `Ref` returning `<layer version ARN>#<statement id>`. Layer policies also gained a real `RevisionId` (a stale one fails `PreconditionFailedException`), principal validation, and AWS's root-ARN statement shape. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CloudWatch Logs — `GetLogGroupFields`** — returns field names found in recent stored events with a rough presence percent (`logGroupFields: [{name, percent}]`). Honors `logGroupName` or `logGroupIdentifier`, optional `time` (±8 minutes) or the default last 15 minutes, system `@*` fields, and flattened JSON message keys. Contributed by @ovsteenb.
- **Step Functions — `aws-sdk:route53` service integration** — a Step Functions task calling the Route 53 SDK integration (e.g. `ChangeResourceRecordSets`) was unsupported. It now serializes the request through the rest-xml path and names an aws-sdk error the AWS way, `Route53.<Error>Exception`. Contributed by @bandle.
- **Step Functions — `States.Base64Encode` / `States.Base64Decode` intrinsics** — the two intrinsic functions are implemented (UTF-8, the documented 10,000-character input cap, lenient decode padding); an over-cap or non-string argument fails the execution with `States.Runtime`. Contributed by @bandle.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::IoT::ThingType`, `AWS::IoT::Policy`, and `AWS::Cognito::IdentityPoolRoleAttachment`** — each type failed a stack with `Unsupported resource type` and rolled it back; they now provision onto their own service (create/delete), so a stack declaring an IoT thing type or policy, or attaching roles to a Cognito identity pool, deploys cleanly. Reported by @iot-rocket.

### Fixed
- **API Gateway (HTTP API / v2) — custom Lambda (`REQUEST`) authorizers are now invoked and enforced** — `_handle_execute_in_scope` only branched on `auth_type == "JWT"`, so a route with a `CUSTOM` authorization type (the type a route gets when it references a `REQUEST` authorizer) fell through unauthenticated: the authorizer Lambda was never invoked at all, regardless of whether the request carried a valid, invalid, or missing token. Adds a REQUEST-authorizer data-plane path mirroring the REST (v1) fix from 1.4.16 (`_authorize_request_v1`) — honors `authorizerPayloadFormatVersion` (1.0 IAM-policy-shaped event vs. 2.0), `enableSimpleResponses` (`{isAuthorized, context}`) vs. IAM policy (`{principalId, policyDocument, context}`) response formats, and `authorizerResultTtlInSeconds` caching — and populates `requestContext.authorizer.lambda` for the downstream integration. Reported against real-world usage; the earlier REST (v1) authorizer fix covered v1 only. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **EventBridge — API destination delivery no longer leaks credentials, and caller-supplied outbound values are validated** — API destination requests now validate every caller-controlled value before it reaches the wire. (1) Delivery and OAuth token requests no longer follow redirects, preventing credentials from reaching another host; `3xx` responses are non-retryable failures. (2) `InvocationEndpoint` and OAuth `AuthorizationEndpoint` must be dialable `http(s)://` URLs. The outbound opener also rejects non-HTTP(S) schemes, while loopback/private/link-local hosts remain allowed for the local emulator. (3) `HttpMethod` and `AuthorizationType` are validated against their API enums. (4) `ApiKeyName` can no longer override reserved headers. (5) `DeauthorizeConnection` removes authorization parameters, and delivery skips connections that are not `AUTHORIZED`. (6) OAuth token responses are capped at 1 MiB. Contributed by @t-rech.
- **Lambda — uncaught handler exceptions report `X-Amz-Function-Error: Unhandled`** — the Docker/RIE executor read the error class off a response header the RIE never sets, so every failure was reported `Handled` and API Gateway consumers keying off the 502-for-Unhandled contract never took the error path. Headerless payloads are now classified by shape: the runtime's error serialization reports `Unhandled`, an HTTP-style envelope with `statusCode` stays `Handled`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **IoT — `CreateThingType` is idempotent for identical re-creates** — re-creating an existing thing type always returned `ResourceAlreadyExistsException`, so a retried request or a re-run provisioning script failed where AWS succeeds. The same `thingTypeProperties` now return the existing ids — absent, `null` and empty compare equal, `searchableAttributes` is unordered — and only a real mismatch keeps the `409`, as `CreateThing` already did. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **EC2 — `RevokeSecurityGroupIngress` / `RevokeSecurityGroupEgress` honour `SecurityGroupRuleIds`** — both read only `IpPermissions`, so a revoke by rule id (as Terraform does) returned `Return=true` while removing nothing, leaving the rule in place forever. Ids now resolve against the group's `sgr-*` rules, which are removed with their tags and echoed in `revokedSecurityGroupRuleSet`; one unknown id rejects the whole call with `InvalidSecurityGroupRuleId.NotFound`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **Cognito — `/oauth2/userInfo` returns custom attributes and the plain `username`** — the response filtered attributes through a fixed standard-OIDC allowlist, dropping `custom:` attributes; it now returns them (as AWS does for `openid` and `openid profile`), plus the plain `username` claim alongside `cognito:username`, and `middle_name`. Contributed by @rjmackay.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::S3::Bucket` `NotificationConfiguration` is applied instead of silently dropped** — the bucket provisioner read only `BucketName` / `VersioningConfiguration`, so a `NotificationConfiguration` (native, or expanded from a SAM `Events: S3` trigger) reached `CREATE_COMPLETE` with no binding and S3 → Lambda/SQS/SNS/EventBridge never fired. It is now routed through the same path `PutBucketNotificationConfiguration` takes (create, update, and clear-on-remove), translating the CloudFormation property names to the S3 API's. Reported by @VictorAlejMadrid.
- **CloudFormation — stack metadata survives a `PERSIST_STATE=1` restart** — a stop/restore kept every provisioned resource but `ListStacks` / `DescribeStacks` / `ListExports` came back empty, because the stack records, events, exports, and change sets were never persisted. They are now saved and restored with the rest of the state. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **S3 — `encoding-type=url` leaves the forward slash intact** — key names, `CommonPrefixes`, and the echoed `Delimiter` percent-encoded `/` as `%2F`, so a delimiter-collapsed "folder" listing was unreadable; `/` is now left alone while spaces and `+` are still encoded, matching S3. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — a delimited listing's `NextMarker` is the common prefix** — when a page ended on a `CommonPrefixes` group, `NextMarker` pointed at an underlying key rather than the prefix, so a client resuming from it re-walked keys it had already been told about as a prefix. `NextMarker` is now the last row returned, and resuming skips the whole group. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — `CopyObject` honours the copy-source date preconditions** — `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` / `-if-unmodified-since` were ignored (only the ETag conditions applied). Both are now evaluated with AWS's documented precedence (`if-match` over `if-unmodified-since`, `if-none-match` over `if-modified-since`), returning `412 PreconditionFailed` on a mismatch. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — a canned ACL expands to its group grants** — `x-amz-acl` at `PutObject`, and a canned `PutObjectAcl`, stored only the owner's `FULL_CONTROL`, so `public-read` reported no public grant. Canned ACLs now expand to the grants they imply (`public-read` → AllUsers `READ`, `public-read-write` → `READ` + `WRITE`, `authenticated-read` → AuthenticatedUsers `READ`), and an invalid canned value is rejected. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — a malformed `Content-MD5` is `InvalidDigest`, not `BadDigest`** — a `Content-MD5` that was not valid base64 or did not decode to 16 bytes returned `BadDigest`, which AWS reserves for a well-formed digest that does not match the body; a malformed value now returns `InvalidDigest`. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — `CompleteMultipartUpload`'s `Location` reflects the request host** — the `Location` was built from a hard-coded `http://localhost:4566`, so it was wrong on any other port or host; it now echoes the endpoint the client reached. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — `PutObject` echoes the bucket's default encryption header** — after `PutBucketEncryption`, a `PutObject` reply carried no `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, so a client could not confirm the object was encrypted as configured; the applied algorithm (`AES256`, or `aws:kms` with its key id) is now stamped on the reply. Reported by @gaul.

### Internal
- **CI — ruff lint gate** — a `Lint` GitHub Actions workflow runs `ruff check ministack/` on pull requests, merge groups, and pushes to `main`/`master`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **CI — the MQTT/WebSocket test surface now runs** — CI installs `websockets`, so `tests/test_iot_data.py` (broker connect/publish/subscribe, retained messages, QoS 1, LWT) is executed instead of `importorskip`-skipped. Reported by  @iot-rocket.
- **Lint baseline cleared** — dropped extraneous f-string prefixes and sorted the `transfer` import block so `ruff check ministack/` is clean. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **RDS — instance-creation helpers refactored** — extracted the `CreateDBInstance` implementation and a shared cluster-member status helper; behavior-preserving. Contributed by @Areson.

## [1.4.16] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Aurora DSQL emulator** — control plane over the REST-JSON API (cluster lifecycle, tags, and cluster policies; `clientToken` idempotency, `deletionProtectionEnabled`, `expectedPolicyVersion` concurrency). With `DSQL_STRICT=1` and Docker, each cluster gets a real Postgres container fronted by an in-process wire-protocol proxy enforcing DSQL's SQL subset; otherwise it goes `ACTIVE` metadata-only. Tunable via `DSQL_BASE_PORT` / `DSQL_STRICT` / `DSQL_PERSIST` / `DSQL_PG_IMAGE`. Contributed by @ry-allan.

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation — resources unchanged by a stack update are left alone** — an unchanged resource was reprocessed on every update, and a type with no update handler fell back to create with a fresh random name, orphaning the real resource (and any `Ref`/`Fn::GetAtt` to it). Unchanged resources are now skipped, and auto-generated names are a deterministic hash of (stack name, logical id). Also fixes the `AWS::Events::EventBus` "already exists" update failure. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Authorizer` survives a property update** — with no update handler, changing a property fell back to create and minted a second, orphaned authorizer; an update handler now mutates the existing record in place. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<...>` parameters resolve against SSM** — the SSM parameter *name* was passed straight through, so `Ref` returned the name instead of the stored value; it's now resolved against Parameter Store (a missing name fails the stack with `ValidationError`). Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **CloudFormation — a `DELETE_COMPLETE` stack's name can be re-created** — a deleted stack stayed addressable by name, so `deploy` took the update path ("cannot be updated") instead of re-creating. A deleted stack is now addressable only by its stack ID; describe/update/change-set by name report "does not exist", so the name re-deploys as a fresh stack. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **S3 — versioned objects retain their custom metadata** — the per-version record dropped `x-amz-meta-*`, preserved headers, and content-encoding, and versioned `GetObject`/`HeadObject` bypassed the metadata emitter; each version now stores and returns its own metadata. Reported by @Kaphaalor.
- **S3 — `GetBucketLocation` returns the bucket's stored region** — the location was compared against the configurable default region (so a non-`us-east-1` default blanked it) and buckets created without a `LocationConstraint` stored no region; a bucket now records its signing region and `GetBucketLocation` echoes it, returning empty only for `us-east-1`. Contributed by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway (REST) — custom Lambda authorizers are invoked on the request path** — a `CUSTOM` method never called its authorizer. `TOKEN`/`REQUEST` authorizers now run on the data path: `401` on a missing identity source, `403` on `Deny`/no-match, `authorizerResultTtlInSeconds` caching, and `context` (stringified) plus `principalId` injected into `requestContext.authorizer`. `AWS_IAM` methods require an `Authorization` header (`403`); SigV4 is not verified. Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **API Gateway (REST) — an unsupported resource or method returns `403`** — an unmatched path returned `404` and a matched resource with no method returned `405`; both now return `403 Missing Authentication Token` (a methodless resource does not fall through to a `{proxy+}` sibling). Reported by @iot-rocket.
- **Route 53 — a change is born `PENDING` then flips to `INSYNC`** — every change was created `INSYNC`, so `GetChange` never returned `PENDING`; changes are now `PENDING` and flip to `INSYNC` on the first `GetChange` read. Reported by @jayjanssen.

## [1.4.15] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- **RDS — `ManageMasterUserPassword` wires Aurora clusters to Secrets Manager** — `CreateDBCluster(ManageMasterUserPassword=true)` previously ignored the flag: no secret was created, no `MasterUserSecret` was returned, and code paths that resolve database credentials from Secrets Manager (the common production pattern) could not be rehearsed locally. The flag now generates a random master password, stores it in MiniStack's own Secrets Manager as `{"username", "password"}` under the AWS naming convention (`rds!cluster-<uuid>`), and returns `MasterUserSecret` (`SecretArn`, `SecretStatus`, `KmsKeyId`) from create/describe/modify. `ModifyDBCluster(RotateMasterUserPassword=true, ApplyImmediately=true)` rotates the real database login through the same path as an explicit password change — including the pending-rotation behavior for stopped compute — and promotes the new credentials to `AWSCURRENT` (previous ones stay readable as `AWSPREVIOUS`); a rotation whose managed secret was deleted out from under RDS fails with `InvalidDBClusterStateFault` and flips `SecretStatus` to `impaired`, as on AWS. `DeleteDBCluster` deletes the managed secret with the cluster (and only when the delete actually succeeds). AWS-exact rejections: `ManageMasterUserPassword` + explicit `MasterUserPassword` at create, explicit password against a managed cluster, `RotateMasterUserPassword` without a managed secret or without `ApplyImmediately`, and explicit password + rotate flag in one request — validated before anything mutates. The RDS↔Secrets Manager seam is in-process and one-directional (rds → secretsmanager), reusing the emulator's existing stage-promotion and replica-sync internals. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **EventBridge — API destination targets are now invoked over HTTP on `PutEvents`** — API destinations and connections were control-plane stubs: a matching rule with an api-destination target logged "unsupported event target ARN" and dropped the event, so webhook-style pipelines (EventBridge → HTTPS endpoint) could not be tested locally. Matching events now POST (or the destination's configured method) to the `InvocationEndpoint` with the input-selected payload (`Input` / `InputPath` / `InputTransformer` apply as for other targets). Connection authorization is honored: `BASIC` populates `Authorization: Basic …`, `API_KEY` sends the configured header, and `OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` exchanges the client ID/secret at the authorization endpoint (`OAuthHttpParameters` merged in, `grant_type=client_credentials` defaulted), caches the token per connection and invalidates it when the connection is deleted, re-authorized, or deauthorized (a connection recreated under a reused name never inherits its predecessor's token), refreshes proactively when it expires within 60 seconds, and refreshes + retries once on a `401`/`407` response — matching documented AWS behavior. Connection `InvocationHttpParameters` and target `HttpParameters` are merged with connection values taking precedence (per the `HttpParameters` API reference), `PathParameterValues` populate `*` path wildcards, and body parameters fold into JSON-object bodies. Requests carry the AWS default headers (`User-Agent: Amazon/EventBridge/ApiDestinations` and `Range` non-overridable, `Content-Type` defaulting to `application/json; charset=utf-8`), strip the headers real EventBridge removes, and time out after 5 seconds (the documented maximum client execution timeout). Delivery runs on a background thread mirroring the SNS HTTP(S) path. Not modeled, mirroring the cross-region FailedInvocations policy: the 24h/185-attempt retry pipeline, `Retry-After`, DLQs, and `InvocationRateLimitPerSecond` — retryable statuses (`401`, `407`, `409`, `429`, `5xx`) are logged and dropped. Contributed by @t-rech.
- **KMS — HMAC keys, `GenerateMac`, and `VerifyMac`** — the four HMAC key specs (`HMAC_224`/`HMAC_256`/`HMAC_384`/`HMAC_512`) with `KeyUsage=GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC`, RFC 2104 HMAC generation and constant-time verification (`KMSInvalidMacException` on mismatch), `MacAlgorithms` in the key metadata, and `DryRun`. HMAC keys are rejected by `Encrypt` / `Decrypt` / `Sign` / `Verify` / `GenerateDataKey*`, and automatic key rotation follows AWS: `EnableKeyRotation` and `DisableKeyRotation` reject them with `UnsupportedOperationException`, while `GetKeyRotationStatus` succeeds and reports `KeyRotationEnabled: false`. Contributed by @nafdev.
- **Lambda — `LAMBDA_KEEPALIVE_MS=0` forces a per-invocation cold start** — a LocalStack-compat lever (not an AWS behavior): for Docker RIE runtimes (Ruby/Java/.NET), `LAMBDA_KEEPALIVE_MS=0` tears the warm container down after each invocation so the next invoke re-runs INIT, giving deterministic cold-start isolation for test suites. Unset or any non-zero value keeps the warm-pool behavior. Reported by @mayankgupta57.

### Fixed
- **Cognito — PreTokenGeneration's `event.request` now carries `clientMetadata` on the operations that actually forward it** — `_build_pretoken_event` never included the key at all, so a Lambda reading `event.request.clientMetadata` always saw it as empty. Per the real AWS Cognito Developer Guide, that field is populated only from `RespondToAuthChallenge`/`AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`'s `ClientMetadata` parameter and, for M2M client-credentials tokens, the `aws_client_metadata` POST field on the token endpoint — Cognito explicitly excludes `InitiateAuth`/`AdminInitiateAuth` (including their `REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` flows) and `GetTokensFromRefreshToken` from this. Both are now threaded through correctly. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **S3 — POST Object no longer misreads form fields as the object body** — a multipart part was classified as the object content when its name was `file` **or** it carried a `filename` attribute, but browsers and HTTP libraries (Python `requests`' `files=`) set `filename` on ordinary form fields, so every field looked like the body, no `key` field survived, and the upload was rejected with `InvalidArgument`. Only the field literally named `file` is the body now, matching S3. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — `GetObject` with `partNumber` returns the requested part** — the `partNumber` parameter was dropped, so a client fetching an N-part object in parallel received N full copies. A completed multipart object now returns the requested part as `206 Partial Content` with a `Content-Range` and `x-amz-mp-parts-count`, matching S3. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — `ListObjectVersions` returns continuation markers when truncated** — a truncated response set `IsTruncated=true` but emitted neither `NextKeyMarker` nor `NextVersionIdMarker`, and the incoming `version-id-marker` was ignored, so a paginating client looped on page one or (as boto3 does) rejected `KeyMarker=None`. The markers are now emitted and `version-id-marker` resumes within `key-marker`. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — `CompleteMultipartUpload` returns `400 MalformedXML` for an unparseable body** — an empty or malformed body raised an unguarded `ParseError` that escaped as a `500` with a JSON document no S3 SDK can parse, so clients treated it as a transient fault and retried. It now returns `400 MalformedXML`, as XML. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — `CompleteMultipartUpload` is idempotent** — the upload record was dropped on the first call, so a retry (how a client recovers from a lost response) returned `NoSuchUpload`. The completed response is now retained and replayed for a repeat call with the same upload id, without minting a second object version, matching S3. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — object owner id is consistent between listings and ACLs** — `ListBuckets` / `ListObjects` / `ListObjectVersions` / `ListParts` hard-coded the owner id `owner-id` while `GetObjectAcl` / `GetBucketAcl` used the account id, so a client matching an object's owner against an ACL grantee always got a mismatch. All of them now use the account id. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — presigned URLs are rejected once expired** — `X-Amz-Date` + `X-Amz-Expires` were never compared against the current time, so a URL minted with a one-second lifetime served the object indefinitely. An expired presigned URL now returns `403 AccessDenied` (`Request has expired`), matching S3. Reported by @gaul.
- **S3 — conditional deletes honour `If-Match`** — `DeleteObject` ignored the `If-Match` header and `DeleteObjects` ignored a per-object `ETag`, so a delete carrying a stale ETag removed the object anyway (and the batch reported it under `Deleted`). `DeleteObject` now returns `412 PreconditionFailed` on an ETag mismatch, and `DeleteObjects` reports the key under `Error` (`PreconditionFailed`) instead of deleting it, matching S3's compare-and-swap delete. Reported by @gaul.
- **CloudWatch Logs — ARN-based tag operations resolve vended-delivery resources** — `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, and `ListTagsForResource` only resolved log-group ARNs, so the AWS provider's read-after-create on `aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery_source` / `aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery_destination` / `aws_cloudwatch_log_delivery` failed with `ResourceNotFoundException` and broke `terraform apply` of any stack using EventBridge bus logging (the community EventBridge module ≥ v4.1 provisions the trio). All three operations now resolve the delivery records' tags. Contributed by @t-rech.
- **Route 53 — `ChangeResourceRecordSets` `DELETE` now requires the values provided to match the current values** — a `DELETE` matched only on name, type, and set identifier, so a delete carrying a stale TTL or stale record values silently removed the live record. Real Route 53 requires the values in a `DELETE` to match the current record exactly and rejects the whole batch with `InvalidChangeBatch` otherwise — the compare-and-swap semantics that guarded-delete workflows (delete only if the record still holds the values I last observed) rely on to detect concurrent modification, which the emulator's silent success defeated. A mismatched `DELETE` now fails the batch atomically with the AWS-shaped message (`Tried to delete resource record set [name='…', type='…'] but the values provided do not match the current values`); record values are compared as an unordered set, so the same values in a different order still match. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **S3 — `CopyObject` and `HeadObject` honour the source `versionId`** — a `?versionId=` on the copy source (and on `HeadObject`) was discarded, so both operated on the current object instead of the requested version. `CopyObject` now copies the exact version and echoes `x-amz-copy-source-version-id`, `HeadObject` returns that version's metadata, and a non-existent version is rejected with `NoSuchVersion`. Reported by @Kaphaalor.
- **SQS — FIFO deduplication holds for the full 5-minute window** — the dedup entry was cleared when a message was deleted (including the Lambda event-source-mapping consume path), so a duplicate sent seconds after the original was consumed was delivered again. A `MessageDeduplicationId` is now retained for its full 5-minute window from send time regardless of receive/delete, matching AWS FIFO semantics. Reported by @giannimassi.
- **S3 — `NewerNoncurrentVersions` survives the lifecycle configuration round-trip** — `NoncurrentVersionExpiration` and `NoncurrentVersionTransition` dropped `NewerNoncurrentVersions` on the `PUT`/`GET` round-trip, so terraform-provider-aws never converged and `terraform apply` of a lifecycle configuration timed out. The field is now emitted and parsed on both rules. Contributed by @sac-outsystems.
- **Step Functions — aws-sdk integration preserves query-protocol singleton lists** — the query-XML to JSON converter collapsed a known list wrapper with an irregular item name (e.g. `VpcSecurityGroups` to `VpcSecurityGroupMembership`) into an object when it held a single item, so SDK consumers expecting a stable list shape broke. Known wrappers now decode to a list for zero, one, or multiple items. Contributed by @Areson.
- **CodeBuild — a timed-out build reports `TIMED_OUT`** — a build stopped by `timeoutInMinutes` was labelled `FAILED` instead of `TIMED_OUT`, so `BatchGetBuilds` could not distinguish a timeout from a genuine build failure. It now reports the `TIMED_OUT` build status, matching AWS.
- **RDS Data API — requests that AWS rejects no longer succeed through permissive fallbacks** — the Data API accepted calls that real AWS refuses, so a local integration passed where the equivalent AWS request would fail. A cluster whose HTTP endpoint is not enabled now returns `HttpEndpointNotEnabledException` (SQL runs only after `EnableHttpEndpoint`); a secret that is absent, scheduled for deletion, or missing a password returns `SecretsErrorException` / `InvalidSecretException`, and this validation now applies in stub mode too. `CommitTransaction` / `RollbackTransaction` now require `resourceArn` and `secretArn` (AWS marks both required), and a transaction is bound to its originating cluster: a mismatched or unknown transaction returns `TransactionNotFoundException` (404) from `ExecuteStatement` / `BatchExecuteStatement` and `NotFoundException` (404) from `CommitTransaction` / `RollbackTransaction`, matching AWS's per-operation error model. Statement timeouts surface as `StatementTimeoutException` and unmodeled stub-mode SQL as `BadRequestException` instead of a fabricated success. Contributed by @Areson.

## [1.4.14] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- **CodeBuild - builds can really run (`MINISTACK_CODEBUILD_EXECUTE=1`)** - `StartBuild` returned a build that was already `SUCCEEDED`, so a pipeline rehearsed against MiniStack reported a pass without a single phase having run, and a buildspec that fails on AWS still looked green locally. With the flag set, `StartBuild` returns `IN_PROGRESS` and the project's inline buildspec is handed to the official AWS CodeBuild local agent (`public.ecr.aws/codebuild/local-builds`), which runs the phases in the project's `environment.image` the way CodeBuild does - the phase semantics come from AWS's own agent instead of a reimplemented executor. `BatchGetBuilds` reflects progress while the build runs: the agent's `Phase complete: <PHASE> State: <STATUS>` lines become `phases` entries, and the container's exit status maps to `SUCCEEDED` / `FAILED`, with `FAULT` when Docker is unreachable. `environment.environmentVariables`, `privilegedMode`, and the `CODEBUILD_BUILD_ID` / `_ARN` / `_NUMBER` / `_INITIATOR` variables reach the build. The build reaches back into MiniStack: `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` (plus placeholder credentials) is injected unless the project declares its own, so `aws s3 cp` inside a build hits this emulator rather than real AWS. `timeoutInMinutes` is enforced (the build is stopped and its phase reported `TIMED_OUT`), and a restored build that was in flight when MiniStack stopped is reported `FAULT` rather than polling as running forever. `StopBuild` is honoured deterministically: it records the intent before removing the container, so the worker reports the requested `STOPPED` instead of racing it to `FAULT`. Build output also reaches CloudWatch Logs: the record already advertised `logs.groupName` / `logs.streamName`, and an executed build now writes the agent output there, so `aws logs get-log-events` and `aws logs tail` read back a real build log instead of an empty stream. Default behaviour is unchanged - without the flag builds stay metadata-only. Requires the Docker socket; the agent image and workspace path are fixed internals, not configurable. Contributed by @igorgawrys1.
- **EventBridge Pipes — the SDK data plane is now reachable** — Pipes was fully built (pipe store, background poller, region scoping, persistence, CloudFormation provisioner) but had no REST route, so `aws pipes list-pipes` fell through to S3 virtual-host addressing and returned `NoSuchBucket`. `ListPipes`, `CreatePipe`, `DescribePipe`, `UpdatePipe`, `DeletePipe`, `StartPipe`, `StopPipe`, and the tag operations are now served over boto3 / Terraform / CDK at `pipes.<region>` and `/v1/pipes`, reusing the existing store.
- **AWS Config** — control plane for config rules, configuration recorders, and delivery channels: `PutConfigRule` / `DescribeConfigRules` / `DeleteConfigRule`, recorder and delivery-channel CRUD plus their status reads, `StartConfigurationRecorder` / `StopConfigurationRecorder`, and the compliance and evaluation-status reads.
- **Cloud Control API (`cloudcontrol`)** — the generic resource control plane behind Terraform's `awscc` provider and CDK L1 constructs: `CreateResource` / `GetResource` / `UpdateResource` / `DeleteResource` / `ListResources` plus the resource-request status and cancel operations, with the AWS `ProgressEvent` and `ResourceDescription` shapes (`Properties` as a JSON string).
- **Cognito — choice-based sign-in in the Hosted UI (`ALLOW_USER_AUTH`)** — the Hosted UI served a single password form regardless of the user pool's sign-in policy. A client whose `ExplicitAuthFlows` includes `ALLOW_USER_AUTH` now drives a multi-step choice-based flow driven by `Policies.SignInPolicy.AllowedFirstAuthFactors`: username, then a challenge-selection screen (skipped when only one factor is allowed), then `PASSWORD` or `EMAIL_OTP` entry, ending in the standard authorization-code redirect. `EMAIL_OTP` codes are fixed at `123456` (consistent with the existing confirmation/reset codes) but verified against the session; `WEB_AUTHN` and `SMS_OTP` are out of scope. Clients without `ALLOW_USER_AUTH` keep the single-page form unchanged. Contributed by @kjdev.
- **KMS — `UpdateKeyDescription`** — the action was not registered, so every call returned `InvalidAction: Unknown action` (HTTP 400) and terraform-provider-aws failed the whole update whenever an `aws_kms_key` description drifted. It now resolves the key by id or ARN, updates the description (an explicit empty string clears it, as on AWS), returns an empty body on success, and `NotFoundException` for an unknown key. Contributed by @sac-outsystems.

### Fixed
- **SNS — `$or` operator in subscription filter policies** — a filter policy with a top-level `$or` key was matched with plain AND semantics, so `$or` never matched and every message was silently dropped as non-matching. `$or` is now evaluated the way AWS does: a recognized `$or` (an array of at least two objects whose field names are not reserved rule keywords) matches when any of its member policies matches, sibling keys are AND-ed with it, member keys are AND-ed internally, and nested `$or` is supported; an unrecognized `$or` is treated as a literal attribute name, as on AWS. Applies to the `MessageAttributes` filter scope. Reported by @StiliyanDr.
- **CloudWatch — `GetMetricData` honours `MetricStat` dimensions** — `GetMetricData` resolved a query by namespace and metric name alone, ignoring `MetricStat.Metric.Dimensions`, so it aggregated across every dimension set and even returned data for a dimension value that was never published. Each `(namespace, name, dimension-set)` is a distinct metric; `GetMetricData` now filters by the query's exact dimensions, matching what `GetMetricStatistics` and `ListMetrics` already do. Reported by @boesing.
- **RDS — `StopDBCluster` / `StartDBCluster` now stop and start Aurora compute** — both operations only flipped metadata: a "stopped" cluster's backing container kept running and accepting SQL connections, and its members never left `available`. `StopDBCluster` now stops the cluster's shared container — preserving the container, volume, and data, exactly like Aurora keeps the cluster volume — and marks the cluster and every member `stopped`. `StartDBCluster` restarts the preserved container (recreating compute from the persistent named volume when the container is gone or unrestartable) and, like `CreateDBInstance`, returns immediately with a transitional status while a readiness worker flips the cluster and members to `available` once the database accepts authenticated connections. Invalid transitions return the AWS-exact `InvalidDBClusterStateFault` messages — including `CreateDBInstance`/`DeleteDBInstance` against a stopped cluster — and a warm boot keeps an intentionally stopped cluster stopped instead of reviving its compute. A start whose compute genuinely fails to come back lands the cluster back on `stopped` (retryable) instead of reporting a dead endpoint as `available`, and a stop that cannot stop the container surfaces an error instead of publishing a false `stopped`. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **RDS — Aurora PostgreSQL engine versions are validated at create time** — `CreateDBCluster` / `CreateDBInstance` accepted any `EngineVersion` string for `aurora-postgresql`: because the Docker image is derived from the major alone, a bogus minor like `16.99` silently ran PostgreSQL 16 while claiming to be `16.99`, and only an unknown major produced a visible image-pull failure. An unknown version — anything `DescribeDBEngineVersions` doesn't advertise and that isn't a dot-boundary prefix of an advertised version (bare majors like `16` stay accepted, since real AWS resolves them server-side) — now fails immediately with `InvalidParameterCombination` / `Cannot find version {version} for aurora-postgresql`, matching real AWS and the existing aurora-mysql behavior; `DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions` rejects unknown versions the same way instead of echoing a fabricated option. The advertised catalog is refreshed to the full creatable set real AWS returns (41 versions, 11.9 through 18.4, including `-limitless` variants, as of 2026-08-06) and is a single shared constant used by both the catalog and the validator; the default `aurora-postgresql` version is now `17.7` (AWS's current default) and the CloudFormation `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` provisioner uses that shared default instead of a hard-coded `15.4`. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **RDS — duplicate DB instance wire code matches AWS** — a duplicate `CreateDBInstance`, `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`, or `RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot` target returned wire code `DBInstanceAlreadyExistsFault`, but real AWS omits the `Fault` suffix for instance-level error codes (cluster-level codes such as `DBClusterAlreadyExistsFault` keep it). SDKs match the exact string to produce their typed error — aws-sdk-go-v2, for example, deserialized the response as a generic API error instead of the typed `DBInstanceAlreadyExistsFault`. The wire code is now `DBInstanceAlreadyExists`. This deliberately reverts the v1.1.18 change, which mistook the SDK exception *shape name* for the *wire code* — the model's `error.code` field (`DBInstanceAlreadyExists`) is what SDKs match, and exact-string tests now pin the correct direction. Contributed by @kiran01bm.
- **Query-protocol services MiniStack does not implement now return a parseable error** — a call to an unimplemented Query service (`redshift`, `elasticbeanstalk`, `cloudsearch`, `sdb`, `importexport`) fell through to S3 and returned a 405 `<Error>` root that botocore's query parser can't read, raising a bare `KeyError('Error')` instead of a `ClientError`. Such requests now return a Query `<ErrorResponse>` envelope (`<Type>Sender</Type>`, code `InvalidAction`) at HTTP 400.
- **AWS Backup, CloudFront, Inspector2, and MediaConnect — unrouted read operations** — services MiniStack ships whose REST sub-paths returned `Unknown path`, so an SDK call reached the service and got an error where AWS returns data. Roughly 96 read operations across the four now return AWS-shaped responses (Backup 47, Inspector2 22, CloudFront 14, MediaConnect 13); operations that require a resource store MiniStack does not keep were left unrouted rather than given a fabricated shape.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::KMS::Key` honours `KeySpec` and update semantics** — the provisioner hard-coded `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT` and dropped `KeyPolicy`, `Tags`, `Enabled`, and `EnableKeyRotation`, so a template asking for an asymmetric or otherwise-specced key reached `CREATE_COMPLETE` while `DescribeKey` reported a symmetric key, and had no update handler (a changed resource minted a brand-new key). It now delegates to `CreateKey` so the CFN and API paths agree, translates `KeyPolicy`/`Tags`, applies `Enabled`/`EnableKeyRotation`/`RotationPeriodInDays`, adds an update handler that fails the immutable `KeySpec`/`KeyUsage`/`Origin`/`MultiRegion` properties and applies the mutable ones in place, schedules deletion (with `DeletionDate`) instead of dropping the key, and fails the stack on an unimplemented spec rather than silently substituting a symmetric key. `RSA_3072` is now creatable via `CreateKey`. Contributed by @hiddengearz.
- **CloudWatch Logs — Insights `toMillis(@timestamp)` filters and `GetQueryResults` pagination** — the Insights subset ignored `filter toMillis(@timestamp) <=|>=|<|>|=|!= <epoch_ms>`, so sort+limit alone returned the wrong edge of the stream, and `GetQueryResults` returned the full result set regardless of `maxItems`. `toMillis(@timestamp)` comparisons are now honoured, and `GetQueryResults` pages with `maxItems` / `nextToken`. Contributed by @ovsteenb.
- **EC2 — `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` / `AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress` echo the existing rule on a duplicate** — both operations skip a rule that already exists (idempotency) but also dropped it from the response, returning an empty `securityGroupRuleSet`; terraform-provider-aws reads `SecurityGroupRules[0]` with no length check and panics. The already-present rule is still not re-appended, but it is now echoed in `securityGroupRuleSet` with the same id `DescribeSecurityGroupRules` reports. This hits egress on the first apply, where `CreateSecurityGroup` seeds the default allow-all rule that Terraform then re-declares. Contributed by @sac-outsystems.

## [1.4.13] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **Docker image — restored to its prior size** — the unpinned `awscli` build dependency floated to 1.46.0, which vendors its own copy of `botocore` and `s3transfer` (~120 MB uncompressed) on top of the `botocore` already installed, inflating the 1.4.12 image by roughly 15 MB. `awscli` is now pinned to 1.45.63 — the last release before the vendored `botocore` — returning the image to its 1.4.11 size.

## [1.4.12] — 2026-08-06

### Added
- **CloudWatch Logs — `GetLogRecord`, Insights `@ptr` rows, and `StartLiveTail`** — `StartQuery` / `GetQueryResults` previously stubbed empty results, so there was no way to obtain an Insights `@ptr` or round-trip `GetLogRecord`. `PutLogEvents` now assigns an opaque pointer per event; Insights queries return matching rows in the AWS field/value shape (`@ptr`, `@timestamp`, `@message`, `@logStream`, `@log`); and `GetLogRecord` resolves those pointers to the full transformed field map (`unmask` accepted, masking not implemented). Insights evaluates a CWLI subset: `fields`, chained `| filter` (`@field = '…'`, `@field like /regex/[i]` with AND semantics), `| sort @timestamp asc|desc`, and `| limit` applied after filter+sort as `min(query limit, StartQuery limit)`. `StartLiveTail` holds a wire-valid `application/vnd.amazon.eventstream` open until client disconnect (`initial-response`, then `sessionStart`, then `sessionUpdate` frames fed by matching concurrent `PutLogEvents`); idle heartbeats are once per second and at most 10 updates are buffered (oldest dropped, `sampled` set). `FilterLogEvents` now returns the `eventId` real AWS assigns, while `GetLogEvents` keeps its `{timestamp, message, ingestionTime}` shape. `DescribeLogGroups` returns both `arn` (with trailing `:*`) and `logGroupArn` (StartLiveTail-safe, no star). Full CWLI (`stats`, `parse`, `or`, …) remains out of scope. Contributed by @ovsteenb.
- **Lambda — `PutFunctionRecursionConfig` / `GetFunctionRecursionConfig`** — the recursion-config sub-resource used by Terraform's `aws_lambda_function_recursion_config` was unrouted, so `GET`/`PUT /2024-08-31/functions/{name}/recursion-config` fell through to a `ResourceNotFoundException`. Both operations are now served: `RecursiveLoop` defaults to `Terminate`, accepts `Allow` / `Terminate`, round-trips per function, and returns `ResourceNotFoundException` for an unknown function. Reported by @mayankgupta57.
- **API Gateway v2 — state is now account- and region-scoped** — HTTP and WebSocket APIs, routes, integrations, stages, deployments, authorizers, responses, and tags were account-scoped, so control-plane resources and execute-api resolution bled across regions. They now scope by account and region, with execute-api dispatch pinning each request to its owning API's region. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **S3 — lifecycle `And` filters no longer hang the Terraform waiter** — a `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` rule using an `And` filter (prefix + tags) never converged, timing out the provider's 3-minute waiter. The AWS provider expands the `And` operator with `ObjectSizeGreaterThan = 0` (and, for a prefixless `And`, `Prefix = ""`), which `GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration` omitted, so the provider's `reflect.DeepEqual` equality check never matched. The `And` operator now echoes `ObjectSizeGreaterThan` (0 when unset) and an empty `Prefix` when unset, and explicit object-size filters round-trip at both the filter and `And` level. Reported by @rogercost.
- **DynamoDB — `Scan` / `Query` with `ProjectionExpression` and no `Select`** — a scan or query supplying only `ProjectionExpression` was rejected with `Select value ALL_ATTRIBUTES is not compatible with ProjectionExpression`. Per the AWS API a `ProjectionExpression` without `Select` is equivalent to `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`; the effective default is now `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` whenever a projection is present, while an explicit incompatible `Select` (`ALL_ATTRIBUTES`, `COUNT`, …) with a `ProjectionExpression` is still rejected. Reported by @jin-gizmo.
- **DynamoDB Streams — long-lived containers no longer accumulate stream backlog** — shard records grew without bound and event-source-mapping poll state was never released, so memory and read latency degraded over a container's lifetime. Stream records now expire after 24 hours and per-mapping poll state is released, with reads resuming from the trim horizon after expiry. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **RDS — DB subnet group and security-group fidelity** — subnet groups did not resolve their VPC or availability zones and `VpcSecurityGroupIds` were dropped on cluster writes. Subnet groups now resolve `VpcId` and AZs from the referenced EC2 subnets and return `InvalidSubnet` for an unknown subnet, and `VpcSecurityGroupIds` on `CreateDBCluster` / `ModifyDBCluster` are preserved rather than mangled by the Query serializer. Contributed by @Areson.
- **EC2 — `DescribeVolumes` now evaluates `Filters`** — the operation ignored `Filters` and returned every volume; it now matches on `volume-id`, `size`, `status`, `volume-type`, `availability-zone`, `snapshot-id`, `create-time`, `encrypted`, `multi-attach-enabled`, `attachment.*`, and `tag:` / `tag-key`. Contributed by @bandle.
- **EC2 — `DescribeSubnets` now evaluates the `cidr-block` filter** — the `cidr-block` / `cidr` / `cidrBlock` aliases were ignored; they now match a subnet's `CidrBlock` exactly. Contributed by @bandle.
- **EC2 — `DescribeInternetGateways` now evaluates `Filters`** — the operation parsed only `InternetGatewayId` and ignored `Filters`, returning every gateway in the account; filters are now applied. Contributed by @bandle.
- **Step Functions — Map `Parameters` applied per item only** — a Map state applied `Parameters` to the state input and then reused it as the per-item selector. `Parameters` is the legacy spelling of `ItemSelector`, so it is now applied only per item. Contributed by @bandle.
- **Step Functions — EC2 `aws-sdk` parameter names no longer over-expanded** — acronym expansion (needed for RDS, e.g. `DbClusterIdentifier` → `DBClusterIdentifier`) was wrongly applied to EC2, mangling already-correct names such as `VpcId` and `EnableDnsHostnames`. EC2 `aws-sdk` parameter names now pass through unchanged. Contributed by @bandle.
- **Lambda — SDK client stub lookup normalized** — JSON-RPC SDK client stubs are now keyed by exact full module specifier (including the `events` and `logs` aliases), preserving bundled-module precedence and the actionable local-executor error for a missing stub. Contributed by @roshie548.
- **Lambda — durable execution restore scoping** — the durable-execution restore path rebuilt timers and callback indexes only for the ambient account, so executions in non-default accounts could stall and non-boot-region executions could re-arm under the wrong region after a restart. Restore now rebuilds across every persisted account scope and derives each execution's account and region from its `DurableExecutionArn`. Contributed by @Areson.

## [1.4.11] — 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Lambda — Function URL data plane** — `CreateFunctionUrlConfig` returned a `{urlId}.lambda-url.{region}.on.aws` URL that nothing served: a request addressed to it matched no route, fell through to S3 virtual-host addressing, and came back as `NoSuchBucket`. Function URLs are now invocable. A request reaching the gateway on a `{urlId}.lambda-url.{region}.*` host — or on the path-based `/_aws/lambda-url/{urlId}/...` form, for clients that can't set `Host` and browsers that won't resolve `*.localhost` — resolves the URL id to its function and invokes it with a payload-format-2.0 event carrying `$default` for `routeKey` and `stage`, `rawPath`/`rawQueryString` percent-encoded as AWS sends them, and `body`/`queryStringParameters` omitted rather than null. `AuthType` is enforced (`AWS_IAM` returns `403 Forbidden` to an unsigned request, header-signed and presigned both pass; `NONE` is open), the `Cors` config drives preflight and response headers with a non-allowed origin getting none, and `InvokeMode: RESPONSE_STREAM` responses are unwrapped from the `HttpResponseStream` framing so the prelude supplies the status and headers instead of leaking into the body. Cookies returned via the format-2.0 `cookies` array become `Set-Cookie` headers. Contributed by @liammizrahi.
- **API Gateway v1 — state is now account- and region-scoped** — REST APIs, resources, methods, integrations, deployments, stages, models, API keys, and usage plans were stored globally and leaked across account and region boundaries. They now scope by account and region; execute-api dispatch resolves a REST API's owning region by id (the mock execute-api host carries no region segment) and runs the invocation in that scope, and a caller-supplied `ms-custom-id` stays unique across the account's regions. Persisted state carries the on-disk format v3 an older binary refuses rather than misreads; legacy snapshots restore into each API's region and v1 tags remain account-scoped. Contributed by @Areson.
- **CloudWatch Logs — Insights queries are now account- and region-scoped** — Logs Insights query ids were account-scoped, so a `StartQuery` in one region could be read or stopped from another, contrary to the regional Logs Insights API. They now scope by account and region; persisted state carries the on-disk format v3 an older binary refuses, and legacy queries restore into their referenced log group's region. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **Step Functions — `aws-sdk:ec2` tasks now return the SDK output shape** — the EC2 Query-XML adapter passed a near-wire structure through without reshaping or typing, so `describeVolumes` returned `VolumeSet.Item.Status` where AWS returns `Volumes[0].State`, scalars were strings, empty collections were `""` instead of `[]`, and a `requestId` the SDK never returns was included — an ASL `Choice` written against AWS silently took the wrong branch locally. The normalizer now follows the SDK output shape: PascalCase member names, `*Set` wrappers pluralized and unwrapped, and list/int/bool leaves coerced, with overrides for names that cannot be inferred (e.g. `keySet` -> `KeyPairs`). Contributed by @bandle.
- **CloudWatch — `DescribeAlarms` and metric reads over CBOR still broke the Terraform AWS provider ≥ 6.50** — after 1.4.10 fixed the alarm timestamp encoding, absent optional fields (`ExtendedStatistic`, `Unit`) were still serialized as CBOR Nil, which the provider's typed smithy-rpc-v2-cbor decoder rejected with `unexpected value type *cbor.Nil`; separately, `GetMetricStatistics` and `GetMetricData` returned their `Timestamp` / `Timestamps` members as strings rather than CBOR tag 1. Absent optional fields are now omitted from every CloudWatch CBOR response (real AWS never sends null), and metric-data timestamps are tag-1 encoded. Reported by @sdreger.

## [1.4.10] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **CloudFront — cache, origin request, and response headers policies** — full CRUD plus `GetConfig` and `ListDistributionsBy...Id` for `CachePolicy` (`/2020-05-31/cache-policy`), `OriginRequestPolicy` (`/origin-request-policy`), and `ResponseHeadersPolicy` (`/response-headers-policy`), so Terraform's `aws_cloudfront_cache_policy`, `aws_cloudfront_origin_request_policy`, and `aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy` create, read, update, and delete end-to-end. Each config round-trips in full: `CachePolicyConfig` (`MinTTL`/`DefaultTTL`/`MaxTTL` and `ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin`), `OriginRequestPolicyConfig` (header/cookie/query-string behaviors and name lists), and `ResponseHeadersPolicyConfig` (CORS, security headers, server-timing, custom and remove headers). `ETag` is returned on every read, `If-Match` is enforced on update/delete (`InvalidIfMatchVersion` / `PreconditionFailed`), and the `...AlreadyExists` / `NoSuch...` / `...InUse` error codes match AWS. Reported by @wparad.
- **Cognito — state is now account- and region-scoped** — user pools, pool domains, identity pools, and identity tags were account-scoped and leaked across regions. They now scope by account and region, and unsigned IDP / Identity data-plane requests infer the owning region from pool and identity IDs, tokens, sessions, or unambiguous client ownership. Persisted state carries the versioned regional schema (on-disk format v3) that an older binary refuses rather than misreads; legacy resources self-place from their region-bearing IDs. Contributed by @Areson.
- **CloudFormation — state is now account- and region-scoped** — stacks, stack events, exports, and change sets were account-scoped, so same-name stacks collided across regions and exports leaked into cross-region `Fn::ImportValue` lookups. They now scope by account and region; asynchronous stack work retains the owning region and nested stacks stay co-located with their parent. Contributed by @Areson.
- **EKS — `ListIdentityProviderConfigs`** — `GET /clusters/{name}/identity-provider-configs` was unimplemented and returned `No route`. It now returns the AWS-shaped `identityProviderConfigs` list (`{name, type}`) and a `ResourceNotFoundException` for an unknown cluster. Contributed by @b-rajesh.
- **DynamoDB PartiQL — `RETURNING`, `REMOVE`, and richer `WHERE` predicates** — `ExecuteStatement` now supports `RETURNING ALL OLD *` / `ALL NEW *` / `MODIFIED OLD *` / `MODIFIED NEW *` on `UPDATE` and `RETURNING ALL OLD *` on `DELETE`, the `REMOVE` clause, and `begins_with` / `IN` / `IS MISSING` / `IS NOT MISSING` predicates. An `UPDATE` whose `WHERE` matches no item now returns `ConditionalCheckFailedException` rather than a silent no-op, matching AWS.

### Fixed
- **IoT — binary topic-rule payloads are no longer corrupted** — the rules engine built every rule event by decoding the payload as UTF-8 with `errors="replace"`, so a payload that is not valid UTF-8 reached the action with each non-ASCII byte replaced by `U+FFFD`. `encode(<expr>, 'base64')` is now supported and encodes the payload as published, so `SELECT encode(*, 'base64') AS data FROM 'telemetry'` delivers `{"data": "<base64>"}` that decodes back to the published bytes — the documented way to reach a Lambda action, which does not accept binary input. No lossy decode remains on the publish → rule → invoke path; a payload that is not valid UTF-8 and whose SELECT projects no attributes dispatches no action rather than dispatching corrupted text. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **IoT — topic-rule SQL is now evaluated** — the rules engine routed a publish to its actions but ignored the rule's `SELECT` clause, so a rule declaring `SELECT deviceId AS id FROM 'sensors/+/telemetry'` delivered the whole message instead of the projection. The SELECT clause is now parsed and projected — `*`, attribute paths, `AS` aliases, `topic()` / `topic(n)`, `timestamp()`, and literals, with unaliased items named as AWS names them and missing attributes omitted — for both delivery paths, Basic Ingest (where `topic()` reports the topic after the rule prefix) and a publish matching the `FROM` filter. A JSON payload under `SELECT *` still arrives as the parsed object. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **ACM — wildcard SAN DNS validation record now matches its base domain** — a certificate with a wildcard subject alternative name emitted a validation `ResourceRecord` named `_acme-challenge.*.example.com`, so Terraform's `aws_acm_certificate_validation` never found the record its `aws_route53_record` had created and failed with `missing DNS validation record`. Real ACM strips the leading `*.`, so `*.example.com` and `example.com` share one `_acme-challenge.example.com` CNAME with an identical name and value. `RequestCertificate` now emits that collapsed record, so the wildcard and apex entries line up and the validation resource resolves. Reported by @wparad.
- **API Gateway — HTTP API routes are selected by specificity, not creation order** — the v2 router returned the first route whose method and path matched in insertion order, so a dedicated route (e.g. `POST /items`) could lose to a greedy `ANY /{proxy+}` catch-all depending on which was created first during `terraform apply`. Matching routes are now ranked so the most specific one wins, as real API Gateway always dispatches to the most specific match. Contributed by @Lukasdoe.
- **EC2 — `DescribeAvailabilityZones` now returns real AZ IDs** — every zone reported its `ZoneId` as a copy of its `ZoneName` (e.g. `us-east-1a` under both), but AWS deliberately differs: names are shuffled per account while IDs are region-coded and stable. `ZoneId` is now the region-coded form (`use1-az1`, `euc1-az1`, `apse2-az1`, …), matching AWS's coding across every region. Contributed by @bandle.
- **DynamoDB — `ProjectionExpression` list-index results no longer carry `null` placeholders** — projecting a list element (e.g. `#i[2]`) returned the element behind sparse `null` entries (`[null, null, {…}]`) instead of the single projected element, and a sibling attribute in the same projection left the placeholders in place. Projected list results are now compacted to only the referenced elements.
- **Persistence — MediaConnect state now persists, and regionalized services carry downgrade protection** — MediaConnect had restore logic but was never registered for saves, so its state was lost across restarts; it now persists. Kinesis, Firehose, KMS, EventBridge, ElastiCache, Pipes, Scheduler, SNS, and MediaConnect now advertise the on-disk format version (v3) that an older binary refuses rather than misreading their region-scoped state. Contributed by @Areson.
- **CloudWatch — `DescribeAlarms` over CBOR broke the Terraform AWS provider ≥ 6.50** — alarm `StateUpdatedTimestamp` / `AlarmConfigurationUpdatedTimestamp` were serialized as bare unsigned integers in the smithy-rpc-v2-cbor response, so the provider's typed decoder (CloudWatch uses CBOR from provider 6.50) failed the read-back with `unexpected value type cbor.Uint` and `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` could not be created. Timestamp members are now encoded as CBOR tag 1 (epoch date-time), which the decoder expects; integer members such as `Period` and `EvaluationPeriods` are unchanged. Reported by @sdreger.

## [1.4.9] — 2026-08-01

### Added
- **Lambda MicroVMs — new service** — control-plane emulation of the AWS Lambda MicroVM API (`2025-09-09`): `RunMicrovm`, `GetMicrovm`, `ListMicrovms`, `SuspendMicrovm`, `ResumeMicrovm`, `TerminateMicrovm`, `CreateMicrovmImage`, `CreateMicrovmAuthToken`, and `CreateMicrovmShellAuthToken`. MicroVMs transition straight to `RUNNING` and images to `CREATED` (no real provisioning); state is account- and region-scoped. Reported by @wparad.
- **Region-scoped state — EC2, CloudTrail, ECR, Glue, OpenSearch, WAFv2, and Backup** now isolate state by account and region, matching real AWS and joining IoT and AppSync Events from 1.4.8. Same-name resources in different regions no longer collide. WAFv2 homes `CLOUDFRONT`-scope resources in us-east-1 with `global`-segment ARNs. Persisted state carries the versioned regional schema (on-disk format v3) that an older binary refuses rather than misreads; legacy resources migrate by ARN region. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Region-scoped state — ACM, Elastic Load Balancing (ALB/NLB), MediaConnect, and RDS Data** now isolate state by account and region as well, using the same versioned regional schema (on-disk format v3) and by-ARN legacy migration.
- **IAM — role update parity** — `CreateRole` and `GetRole` now round-trip `PermissionsBoundary`; `PutRolePermissionsBoundary` / `DeleteRolePermissionsBoundary` update it with AWS-shaped role output and missing-role errors; and `UpdateRoleDescription` now returns and persists the updated role. This unblocks Terraform providers that reconcile fixed boundaries and descriptions on service roles. Contributed by @jayjanssen.

### Changed
- **S3 — presigned URL signatures are now verified** — presigned SigV4 URLs were accepted without checking the signature, so a URL signed with bogus credentials, or one whose signed headers (`content-type`, `content-length`, …) were changed after signing, still succeeded. Presigned URLs are now verified against the server credential (`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, default `test`); a bad signature or a tampered signed header returns `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch`, matching real S3. Header-signed and anonymous requests are unaffected. Reported by @BartekAndree.

### Fixed
- **Step Functions — `aws-sdk:s3:headObject` dropped the object's user `Metadata` map** — the S3 REST-XML SDK-integration spec maps response headers to output fields by exact name, which cannot express the N dynamic `x-amz-meta-*` headers, so the task result carried no `Metadata` key and an ASL reading `$.Metadata.<key>` (e.g. `States.StringToJson($.Metadata.shardcount)` to size a downstream fan-out) failed with `States.Runtime`. The dispatcher now collects `x-amz-meta-*` response headers into a `Metadata` map with the prefix stripped, attached after the SFN key-convention pass so the metadata keys stay verbatim (lowercase, as S3 stores them) instead of being title-cased like API member names. Contributed by @michael-denyer.
- **Cognito — `CUSTOM_AUTH` now honors Cognito-owned SRP challenges and passes `ClientMetadata` to DefineAuth** — Amplify `CUSTOM_WITH_SRP` failed with `USER_ID_FOR_SRP was not found` because `CUSTOM_AUTH` always invoked CreateAuth and returned `CUSTOM_CHALLENGE`, even when DefineAuth returned `PASSWORD_VERIFIER` / `SRP_A`. InitiateAuth with `SRP_A` now records `SRP_A` success (AWS-like), returns built-in `PASSWORD_VERIFIER` challenge parameters, and continues the custom-auth session after RespondToAuthChallenge so MFA `CUSTOM_CHALLENGE` rounds still work. DefineAuth also receives `ClientMetadata` (previously hard-coded `{}`), matching Create/Verify. Contributed by @onelshina.
- **EC2 - `ModifySecurityGroupRules`** - this action was unimplemented and returned `InvalidAction: Unknown EC2 action: ModifySecurityGroupRules`. Full support is now provided. Contributed by @staranto.
- **Step Functions — `aws-sdk` integrations for Query-protocol services sent malformed requests** — the shared adapter numbered EC2 list parameters under the wrong wire names and passed the form body as a string rather than bytes, so calls such as `aws-sdk:ec2:describeInstances` and `aws-sdk:sqs:getQueueAttributes` failed or silently dropped parameters. EC2 list parameters are now numbered under their botocore wire names, the body is encoded to bytes, `GetQueueAttributes` returns the SDK `Attributes` map, and `IsTruncated` is emitted as a boolean. Contributed by @bandle.
- **Step Functions — wildcard path projections now resolve** — JSONPath wildcard (`[*]`) projections in ASL returned incorrect results. Contributed by @felixp-square.
- **IoT — topic-rule Lambda action resolved the function in the wrong region** — after IoT state became region-scoped, a topic rule invoking a Lambda action looked the function up in the request region rather than the function's own, so cross-region rule targets missed. Contributed by @Areson.
- **S3 — `GetBucketEncryption` now returns the default SSE-S3 configuration** — a bucket with no explicit encryption returned `ServerSideEncryptionConfigurationNotFoundError`, but since 5 January 2023 every S3 bucket has default SSE-S3 encryption, so real S3 returns an `AES256` configuration. `GetBucketEncryption` now returns that default (matching AWS) rather than the error. Reported by @rsariyev-nav.
- **SNS — subscription filter policies now match `String.Array` message attributes** — a `FilterPolicy` compared the raw `StringValue` of a `String.Array` attribute (e.g. `["example.created"]`) against the policy values, so array attributes never matched. Each element of a `String.Array` attribute is now evaluated separately, matching AWS. Reported by @cabrerafd.

## [1.4.8] — 2026-07-28

### Added
- **IoT — state is now account- and region-scoped** — the control plane (Things, thing types, thing groups, certificates, policies, topic rules, device shadows) and the MQTT broker (clients, persistent sessions, subscriptions, retained messages) were account-scoped, so same-name resources, subscriptions, and retained messages collided or leaked across regions. All of it now scopes by account and region; the request region threads through the HTTP and WebSocket MQTT paths, and exact account/region scope is required before topic-wildcard matching so signer-controlled values can't cross regions. Persisted state carries a versioned regional schema (on-disk format v3) that an older binary refuses rather than misreads; legacy resources migrate by ARN region and retained messages migrate to the boot region. Contributed by @Areson.
- **AppSync Events — state is now account- and region-scoped** — Event APIs, channel namespaces, and API keys were account-scoped and collided across regions. They now scope by account and region, with the WebSocket and HTTP data planes resolving an API's creation region while preserving SigV4 credential-region enforcement, advertised-host validation, and per-API fan-out isolation. Persisted state carries the versioned regional schema (on-disk format v3) an older binary refuses; legacy child records migrate with their parent API. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **Step Functions — context object paths now resolve array indexes** — JSONPath references such as `$$.Map.Item.Value.values[0].name` returned `null` because context paths used a separate dotted-key-only resolver. Context paths now retain their distinct `$$.` root while sharing the standard path traversal, so indexed references work in `ItemSelector` fields and intrinsic-function arguments. Contributed by @felixp-square.
- **S3 Tables — Iceberg REST commits duplicated schema/spec/sort-order entries, crashing Spark on load** — `_iceberg_commit_table` appended unconditionally on `add-schema`/`add-spec`/`add-sort-order`, but Spark re-declares its current unchanged schema, partition spec, and sort order on every write, so a second commit produced a duplicate id and the next table load failed building Iceberg's id-keyed maps (`Multiple entries with same key`). These updates are now idempotent by id, matching the invariant Iceberg's own `TableMetadata` builder enforces. `add-snapshot` deduplication is intentionally not added — that is an optimistic-concurrency concern, not a structural one. Contributed by @squirmy.
- **S3 Tables — `AWS::S3Tables::Table` CloudFormation ignored the declared schema** — the provisioner hardcoded an empty Iceberg schema and never read `IcebergMetadata.IcebergSchema.SchemaFieldList`, so every table created through CloudFormation had zero columns regardless of the template, and downstream consumers failed (a Firehose Iceberg-destination delivery errored with `does not have a column with name …`). The provisioner now parses `SchemaFieldList` (`Name`/`Type`/`Required`) into the table's Iceberg schema, the same way the `CreateTable` API path does. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **CloudFormation — cross-stack CDK deploys crashed with `'dict' object has no attribute 'startswith'`** — `aws-cdk-local` rewrites a CDK cross-stack reference into the non-AWS `Fn::GetStackOutput` intrinsic instead of `Fn::ImportValue`, and the engine never resolved it, so the unresolved dict reached a provisioner (for example an `AWS::Lambda::Permission` `FunctionName`) and rolled the stack back. The engine now resolves `Fn::GetStackOutput` to the named output of the referenced already-deployed stack, so `cdklocal deploy --all` across dependent stacks works. Reported by @jacsonrsasse.

## [1.4.7] — 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore — new service emulator** — the agent-runtime control plane and data plane are now emulated. The `bedrock-agentcore-control` endpoint implements `CreateAgentRuntime`, `GetAgentRuntime`, `ListAgentRuntimes`, `UpdateAgentRuntime`, `DeleteAgentRuntime`, `ListAgentRuntimeVersions`, and the runtime-endpoint operations (`CreateAgentRuntimeEndpoint`, `GetAgentRuntimeEndpoint`, `ListAgentRuntimeEndpoints`, `UpdateAgentRuntimeEndpoint`, `DeleteAgentRuntimeEndpoint`); the `bedrock-agentcore` data-plane endpoint implements `InvokeAgentRuntime`, which returns the invocation payload echoed back. `CreateAgentRuntime` reports `CREATING` and `UpdateAgentRuntime` reports `UPDATING` before settling to `READY`, each update bumps `agentRuntimeVersion`, ARNs follow the real `agent/{uuid}:{version}` and `agentEndpoint/{uuid}` shapes, and all state is account+region scoped. Reported by @wolfgangmeyers.
- **SNS — `ListPlatformApplications`** — the mobile-push action returned `InvalidAction` even though platform applications created with `CreatePlatformApplication` were already stored. It now lists the caller's platform applications with their attributes and `NextToken` pagination; results are account+region scoped, matching AWS's per-region platform applications. Reported by @ctalibard-sk.
- **Kinesis Data Firehose — `AWS::KinesisFirehose::DeliveryStream` CloudFormation support** — stacks containing a delivery stream failed with `Unsupported resource type` even though the Firehose API already implemented `CreateDeliveryStream`. The resource now provisions through CloudFormation into the existing Firehose control plane (S3, Extended S3, Iceberg, and the other destination configs), `Ref` returns the delivery stream name, and `Fn::GetAtt Arn` returns its ARN. Contributed by @squirmy. Reported by @ryan-bennett.
- **Kinesis Data Firehose — Apache Iceberg (S3 Tables) delivery** — a DirectPut delivery stream with an `IcebergDestinationConfiguration` now actually writes records into the target S3 Tables Iceberg table, not just provisions the stream. Each record routes to its destination table from the `DestinationTableConfigurationList` (or a transform Lambda's `metadata.otfMetadata`), and the row operation follows real Firehose Merge-on-Read semantics: `insert` by default, `update`/`delete` matched on the table's `UniqueKeys` (a record whose operation needs keys but has none is dropped to the error path, as on AWS). Rows are written through the S3 Tables Iceberg REST catalog using the bundled DuckDB engine and are immediately queryable. Reported by @ryan-bennett.
- **Region scoping — Amazon MWAA, Amazon EKS, and AWS Transfer Family** — state is now isolated by account and region, so same-named resources in different regions no longer collide. Persisted state carries a versioned regional schema (on-disk format v3) that an older binary refuses rather than misreads. Contributed by @Areson.
- **S3 — `GetObjectAttributes`** — `GET /{bucket}/{key}?attributes` returned the object body instead of the attributes document. It now returns a `GetObjectAttributesResponse` carrying only the fields named in the required `x-amz-object-attributes` header (`ETag`, `Checksum`, `ObjectParts`, `StorageClass`, `ObjectSize`): the `ETag` is emitted without the surrounding quotes the HTTP header carries, `StorageClass` is omitted for S3 Standard objects (as on AWS), `Checksum` reports the object's stored checksum with its `ChecksumType`, and `ObjectParts` lists the parts of a multipart-completed object. Honors `versionId`, and returns `NoSuchKey`/`NoSuchBucket` for missing objects. Reported by @JayJuch.

### Fixed
- **SQS — `QueueUrl` used a hardcoded `localhost` host, breaking Docker-executed Lambdas** — a Node.js Lambda running under `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker` could not post to SQS without hardcoding the endpoint in its client: the AWS JS SDK v3 SQS client uses the returned `QueueUrl` as its request endpoint (`useQueueUrlAsEndpoint`), and every URL was rendered as `http://localhost:4566/…`, which inside the Lambda container resolves to the container itself rather than the host running MiniStack, so the request failed with connection refused. `CreateQueue`, `GetQueueUrl`, and `ListQueues` now render `QueueUrl`(s) using the caller's incoming `Host` header (how they actually reached MiniStack, e.g. `host.docker.internal:4566`), the same approach LocalStack takes; internal queue state stays keyed on canonical URLs and lookups remain host-agnostic. An explicitly configured `MINISTACK_HOST` pins the host and disables the rewrite. Contributed by @thejusdutt. Reported by @Millroy094.
- **DynamoDB — validation and read metering aligned with real AWS** — a batch of parity fixes driven by the dynamodb-conformance suite. Numeric values with surrounding whitespace or underscores (`" 5"`, `"1_000"`) are now rejected; document nesting is capped at 32 levels; partition and sort key values are capped at 2048 and 1024 bytes and expression strings at 4096 bytes. `CreateTable` validates index `Projection` settings (`INCLUDE` requires `NonKeyAttributes`, `KEYS_ONLY` forbids them, unknown types are rejected) and rejects a `StreamSpecification` with `StreamEnabled: false` alongside a `StreamViewType`. `UpdateTable` merges `AttributeDefinitions` by name and prunes ones no longer referenced by the key schema or any index. `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, and `BatchWriteItem` reject wrong-typed, non-scalar, or empty values written into a secondary-index key attribute. `Query` and `Scan` reject incompatible `Select`/`ProjectionExpression` combinations with the AWS messages, and a composite index excludes items missing its range key (sparse indexes). `ConditionExpression` `BETWEEN` validates that the lower bound does not exceed the upper at parse time. PartiQL `UPDATE`/`DELETE` return `{"Items": []}` rather than an empty object. Eventually-consistent reads now meter 0.5 RCU (strongly-consistent reads 1.0). Empty binary set members are accepted; only empty string-set members are rejected.
- **S3 Tables — Iceberg REST catalog returned AWS-shaped errors instead of the spec envelope** — the `/iceberg` endpoints returned `{"__type": "NotFoundException", ...}` on a missing namespace or table, but the Iceberg REST OpenAPI requires `{"error": {"message", "type", "code"}}`. Spec-compliant REST clients (DuckDB, Spark, Trino) treat a `LoadTable` 404 as "proceed to create", but only when it is a proper `NoSuchTableException`; the AWS shape made them abort, so writing to an S3 Tables Iceberg table over the REST catalog failed. Errors on the `/iceberg` surface now use the REST spec envelope (`NoSuchTableException` / `NoSuchNamespaceException`), leaving the S3 Tables control plane's AWS error shape unchanged.
- **Lambda (Docker executor) — Docker-in-Docker ZIP functions failed with `invalid mount config for type "bind"`** — when MiniStack ran inside a container and `LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER_VOLUME_MOUNT` was set (as the README previously advised), the runtime container was created with a bind mount whose source was the *volume name* rather than an absolute path, so Docker rejected it with `mount path must be absolute` and every ZIP invocation failed. In-container runs now always populate the sibling container's `/var/task` (and `/var/runtime` for `provided.*`) via `docker cp` over the host socket — no shared volume required. `LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER_VOLUME_MOUNT` is deprecated and ignored. Reported by @smoores-dev.
- **Cognito — pools with `UsernameAttributes` used the raw email or phone number as `Username` instead of a generated UUID** — in a user pool configured for email or phone sign-in (`UsernameAttributes`), `AdminCreateUser` stored and returned the submitted email/phone as the `Username`, but real Cognito treats that value as an alias and assigns an immutable system-generated UUID as the actual `Username`. The `Username` is now a UUID for `UsernameAttributes` pools, the alias resolution paths (invitation email, duplicate detection, Hosted UI login) key off it, and changing the email attribute afterwards no longer changes the `Username`. Contributed by @kjdev.

## [1.4.6] — 2026-07-24

### Added
- **EC2 — `AWS::EC2::VPCEndpoint` CloudFormation support** — VPC endpoints now provision through CloudFormation into the shared EC2 state, so `DescribeVpcEndpoints` returns them; `Ref` returns the `vpce-` id and `Fn::GetAtt` exposes `Id`. Endpoint type, VPC/route/subnet/security-group associations, tags, and in-place updates are supported. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **API Gateway v1 — `AWS::ApiGateway::DocumentationVersion` CloudFormation support** — documentation versions now create, update, and replace through CloudFormation; `Ref` returns the `{RestApiId}/{DocumentationVersion}` identity, and a version change triggers replacement. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **API Gateway v1 — `AWS::ApiGateway::RequestValidator` CloudFormation support** — request validators now provision through CloudFormation; both `Ref` and `Fn::GetAtt RequestValidatorId` return the validator id. A `Name` or `RestApiId` change triggers replacement while the validation flags update in place. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **AppSync — `AWS::AppSync::FunctionConfiguration` CloudFormation support** — pipeline functions now provision through CloudFormation; `Ref` returns the function ARN and `Fn::GetAtt` exposes `FunctionArn`, `FunctionId`, `Name`, and `DataSourceName`. An `ApiId` change triggers replacement. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **Lambda — `AWS::Lambda::Url` CloudFormation support** — function URLs now provision through CloudFormation and share the Function URL API state; `Fn::GetAtt` exposes `FunctionArn` and `FunctionUrl`, `AuthType`/`InvokeMode`/`Cors` update in place, and a `TargetFunctionArn` or `Qualifier` change triggers replacement. `UpdateFunctionUrlConfig` now also applies `InvokeMode`. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **CloudWatch Logs — `AWS::Logs::ResourcePolicy` CloudFormation support** — resource policies now provision through CloudFormation; `Ref` returns the `PolicyName`, a policy-document change updates in place, and a `PolicyName` change triggers replacement. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **CloudFront — `AWS::CloudFront::CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity` CloudFormation support** — origin access identities now provision through CloudFormation; `Ref` returns the identity id (`E…`) and `Fn::GetAtt` exposes `Id` and `S3CanonicalUserId`, both retained across comment updates. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **API Gateway v1 — `GetExport`** — a REST API stage can now be exported as OpenAPI 3 (`oas30`) or Swagger 2 (`swagger`), in JSON or YAML, with the optional `integrations` extension included on request. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **RDS — Aurora MySQL global replication** — Aurora MySQL 8 global clusters now replicate from the global writer to secondary-region readers over GTID-based binary log replication, with binlog retention bounded on the source and fail-closed handling for volumes initialized by an older version. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Region scoping — Athena, Auto Scaling, Cloud Map, EFS, EMR, Inspector2, Amazon MQ, AppSync, and S3 Files** — state is now isolated by account and region, so same-named resources in different regions no longer collide. Persisted state carries a versioned regional schema (on-disk format v3) that an older binary refuses rather than misreads, and legacy state migrates by recovering each record's region from its stored ARNs. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v2 — `queryStringParameters`/`body` sent as `null` instead of omitted** — the HTTP API v2 Lambda proxy event included `queryStringParameters`/`body` with a `null` value when a request had no query string or no payload, rather than omitting the key entirely as real AWS does. Strict event-shape validators (e.g. AWS Lambda Powertools' `isAPIGatewayProxyEventV2`) accept `undefined` or a proper value but reject `null`, so every bodyless or querystring-less request against such a validator failed with an unhandled `InvalidEventError`, even though the invocation itself succeeded and the Lambda's own business logic never ran. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **Cognito — Hosted UI bound the authorization code to the raw email alias instead of the resolved Username** — in pools with `UsernameAttributes` or `AliasAttributes`, the email entered on the Hosted UI login page was bound to the authorization code verbatim, so the code exchange keyed off the alias rather than the user's real Username. The login and new-password submit paths now bind the code to the Username resolved by the alias lookup. Contributed by @kjdev.
- **CloudFormation/Lambda — Docker-executed custom resources hung because the `ResponseURL` used `localhost`** — with `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker`, a Lambda-backed custom resource completed its work but could not post its completion callback: the `ResponseURL` pointed at `localhost`, which inside the Lambda container resolves to the container itself rather than the host running MiniStack, so the PUT failed with connection refused and the stack sat in `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` until the one-hour service timeout. The `ResponseURL` handed to a container-executed custom resource now rewrites `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` to `host.docker.internal`, the same host already used for `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`; explicitly configured hostnames are left untouched. Reported by @robert-pitt-foodhub.

## [1.4.5] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **API Gateway v1 — `AWS::ApiGateway::Model` CloudFormation support** — stacks with request/response models failed with `Unsupported resource type: AWS::ApiGateway::Model`. Models now create, update, and delete against the v1 model store; JSON-valued schemas are normalized to the API's string representation and `Ref` returns the model name. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **API Gateway v1 — `AWS::ApiGateway::DomainName` CloudFormation support** — CDK custom-domain stacks rolled back with `Unsupported resource type`. Regional and edge domains now provision through the v1 control plane; `Ref` returns the domain name and `Fn::GetAtt` exposes `DistributionDomainName`, `DistributionHostedZoneId`, `DomainNameArn`, `RegionalDomainName`, and `RegionalHostedZoneId`. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **API Gateway v1 — `AWS::ApiGateway::BasePathMapping` CloudFormation support** — base path mappings now create, update, replace, and delete; an omitted `BasePath` maps to the root `(none)` mapping and `Ref` returns the mapping's identifier. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **API Gateway v1 — documentation parts** — `CreateDocumentationPart`, `GetDocumentationPart`, `GetDocumentationParts`, `UpdateDocumentationPart`, and `DeleteDocumentationPart`, plus `AWS::ApiGateway::DocumentationPart` CloudFormation support. `Ref` returns the documentation part id and `Fn::GetAtt DocumentationPartId` is exposed. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **Lambda — `AWS::Lambda::EventInvokeConfig` CloudFormation support** — CDK stacks configuring asynchronous retry limits, maximum event age, or on-success/on-failure destinations rolled back with `Unsupported resource type`. Configs are now isolated per function qualifier (version/alias), and `GetFunctionEventInvokeConfig` / `ListFunctionEventInvokeConfigs` return them per qualifier. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **CloudWatch — `AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard` CloudFormation support** — stacks containing dashboards rolled back with `Unsupported resource type`. Dashboards now create, update the body in place, replace on a name change, and delete; `Ref` returns the dashboard name. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **OpenSearch — `AWS::OpenSearchService::Domain` CloudFormation support** — domains and CDK-generated access policies now provision through CloudFormation with in-place updates, replacement, rollback, and `Fn::GetAtt` for the domain ARN and endpoint. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **OpenSearch — package management** — `CreatePackage`, `UpdatePackage`, `DescribePackages`, `DeletePackage`, `AssociatePackage`, `DissociatePackage`, and `ListPackagesForDomain` are now served. Packages report `AVAILABLE` and domain associations `ACTIVE` immediately, so a poll after create/update/associate succeeds on the first call. Reported by @Simon-Hayden-Dev.
- **Cognito — `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolGroup` CloudFormation support** — the raw group APIs existed but the CFN resource type failed the whole stack with `Unsupported resource type`. Groups now provision through CloudFormation, `Ref` returns the group name, and deletion removes the group from its member users. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **Cognito — resource servers** (`CreateResourceServer`, `UpdateResourceServer`, `DescribeResourceServer`, `DeleteResourceServer`, `ListResourceServers`) plus `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolResourceServer` CloudFormation support. Every resource-server action previously returned `InvalidAction: Unknown Cognito IDP action` and the CFN resource type failed the whole stack. Resource servers are keyed by their caller-supplied `Identifier` within a pool, matching real AWS, and `Ref` on the CFN resource returns that `Identifier`. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **Cognito — `GetTokensFromRefreshToken`** — the session-refresh action aws-amplify v6.15+ uses exclusively returned `InvalidAction: Unknown Cognito IDP action`, so Amplify apps silently lost their session when the access token expired. It now returns the same `AuthenticationResult` shape as `REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`; refresh token rotation and `RefreshTokenReuseException` are not modeled. Reported by @scriptgenerator64.
- **Region scoping — Batch and SES** — state is now isolated by account and region, so same-named resources in different regions no longer collide. Persisted state carries a versioned regional schema that an older binary refuses rather than misreads. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **CloudFront — invalidations on CloudFormation-created distributions** — `CreateInvalidation` on a distribution provisioned through CloudFormation raised a `KeyError` because the CFN path never initialized the invalidation store that the native `CreateDistribution` does. The store is now initialized on create and cleaned up on delete. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **CloudFormation/Lambda — CDK S3 bucket notification custom resources no longer hang** — custom-resource properties reached CDK's bundled handler as Python `bool`/numbers instead of CloudFormation's string wire representation (it called `.lower()` on `Managed`), and the warm Python worker omitted `log_stream_name`, so the failure path couldn't PUT to the `ResponseURL` and the stack hung until the one-hour service timeout. Custom-resource properties now use the string representation and warm workers expose the standard Lambda context fields. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **API Gateway v1 — `AWS::ApiGateway::Stage` `Ref`** — `Ref` returned `<api-id>-<stage>` instead of the stage name, so dependent resources failed `GetStage` with `Invalid Stage identifier specified`. `Ref` now returns the stage name, matching AWS. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **SQS — `ListQueues` pagination** — results were silently truncated at `MaxResults` and no `NextToken` was returned or accepted, so a client with more than 1000 queues could not enumerate them all. `ListQueues` now returns a `NextToken` when more results remain and accepts it on the next page, across both the JSON and Query/XML protocols. Contributed by @bfreitastgtg.
- **EC2 — `DescribeSecurityGroupRules` tags** — the operation omitted each rule's `Tags` and `SecurityGroupRuleArn`, so Terraform's `aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule` saw perpetual `tags_all` drift. Rule tags set at authorize time (or via `CreateTags` on the `sgr-` id) are now stored and returned along with the rule ARN, and `tag:`/`tag-key` filters are honored. Reported by @staranto.
- **Cognito — `AWS::Cognito::UserPool` `LambdaConfig` dropped by CloudFormation** — the CFN provisioner built a pool's state without ever reading `LambdaConfig` from the template properties, so any Lambda trigger (PreTokenGeneration, PreSignUp, PostConfirmation, etc.) configured on a CFN-provisioned pool was silently never invoked, even though the identical raw `CreateUserPool` API call already honored it correctly. `LambdaConfig` is now copied onto the pool the same way the raw API does. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.

## [1.4.4] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **RDS — `DisableHttpEndpoint`** — the Aurora Data API HTTP endpoint could be enabled via `EnableHttpEndpoint` but never disabled: `DisableHttpEndpoint` returned `InvalidAction`. It now mirrors enable, setting `HttpEndpointEnabled` to `false` on the cluster matching `ResourceArn`. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **ALB — data-plane forwarding to `instance`/`ip` targets** — the ALB data plane routed live traffic to Lambda targets only; `instance`/`ip` target groups returned `502 Target type not supported`. Requests are now proxied over HTTP to the registered target with hop-by-hop headers stripped, `X-Forwarded-*` and `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` injected, and connection failures surfaced as `502`. Contributed by @jasondcamp.
- **ElastiCache — Valkey engine** — `Engine=valkey` fell into the memcached branch, requesting a nonexistent image and falling back to memcached's port 11211. `CreateCacheCluster`/`CreateReplicationGroup` now spawn a real `valkey/valkey:<major.minor>-alpine` container on port 6379 (AWS versions 7.2, 8.0, 8.1), and `DescribeCacheEngineVersions` lists them. Contributed by @jasondcamp.
- **KMS — `GenerateDataKeyPair` and `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext`** — the emulator had `GenerateDataKey` but no data-key-*pair* operation, so both returned `InvalidAction`. They now generate an asymmetric data key pair wrapped under a symmetric CMK (the `WithoutPlaintext` variant omits `PrivateKeyPlaintext`) across the AWS `KeyPairSpec` enum, `SM2` excluded. Contributed by @yl.
- **API Gateway v1 — `AWS::ApiGateway::GatewayResponse` (CloudFormation)** — CDK/CloudFormation stacks customizing REST API errors rolled back with `Unsupported resource type`. The v1 control plane now serves `PutGatewayResponse`/`GetGatewayResponse(s)`/`DeleteGatewayResponse`, and the resource provisions with in-place updates and generated-default restore on delete. Contributed by @robert-pitt-foodhub.
- **Cognito — `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` in the Hosted UI** — a first-login `FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD` user was let straight through the managed-login endpoint, issuing an OAuth code without ever changing the temporary password. The Hosted UI now shows a change-password form, enforces the pool policy, and completes to the code once the password is set. Contributed by @kjdev.
- **s3tables — CloudFormation and Iceberg REST** — `AWS::S3Tables::TableBucket`/`Namespace`/`Table` now provision through CloudFormation, and the Iceberg REST catalog surface (config, namespaces, tables, load-table, commit) is served for table buckets, backed by DuckDB. Contributed by @squirmy.
- **RDS — Aurora shared-storage model** — cluster members previously provisioned diverging per-instance databases. They now share one cluster-owned container, so tables, users, and grants created through one member are visible through the writer and reader endpoints and the RDS Data API. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Region scoping — EventBridge Scheduler, CodeBuild, and Resource Groups** — state is now isolated by account and region, so same-named resources in different regions no longer collide. Persisted state carries a versioned regional schema that an older binary refuses rather than misreads. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation/Lambda — CDK S3 bucket notification custom resources no longer hang** — `Custom::S3BucketNotifications` received boolean properties as Python `bool` values even though CloudFormation serializes custom-resource primitive leaves as strings, so CDK's bundled handler crashed when it called `.lower()` on `Managed`. Its failure-reporting path then crashed again because the warm Python Lambda context omitted `log_stream_name`, preventing the handler from PUTting `FAILED` to the CloudFormation `ResponseURL` and leaving the stack in `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` until the one-hour service timeout. Custom-resource properties now use CloudFormation's string wire representation, and warm Python workers expose the standard Lambda context fields, including log group/stream names, function version, client/identity placeholders, and remaining execution time.
- **Batch — `UpdateComputeEnvironment`** — Terraform `aws_batch_compute_environment` with an `update_policy` block failed with `InvalidAction`. `UpdateComputeEnvironment` now resolves the compute environment by name or ARN and applies `state`, `serviceRole`, `computeResources`, `updatePolicy`, `unmanagedvCpus`, and `context`. Reported by @smoores-dev.
- **S3 — empty object tag value** — a bare `x-amz-tagging` key with no `=value` was dropped instead of stored. Empty tag values are now preserved as a tag with an empty value, matching real S3. Contributed by @murlock.
- **EC2 — `DescribeSecurityGroupRules` by rule id** — the operation ignored `SecurityGroupRuleIds` (a group filter was required) and rule ids shifted when another rule on the group was revoked. Rule ids are now stable and content-derived and `SecurityGroupRuleIds` is honored, fixing Terraform `aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule` refresh. Reported by @staranto.
- **Lambda — docker worker respawn on config change** — with `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker`, `UpdateFunctionConfiguration` left the old container running with stale config because the reaper matched the pre-region-scoping key shape. It now reaps the function's containers so the next invocation uses the new configuration. Reported by @ykharko.

## [1.4.3] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- **IoT — device shadow operations** — `GetThingShadow`, `UpdateThingShadow`, and `DeleteThingShadow` on the `iot-data` endpoint (classic and named shadows via `?name=`) previously returned `InvalidRequestException: Unsupported iot-data path: .../shadow`. Shadows now store `desired`/`reported` state: updates deep-merge into the stored document (a `null` value removes the field), bump the version, and stamp per-attribute `metadata` timestamps (only the attributes an update touches are re-stamped); the `/accepted` response echoes only the sections sent, while `GetThingShadow` returns the full document including the computed `state.delta` and its `metadata.delta`. A stale `version` in an update is rejected with a `409`, deleting a shadow keeps its version (as on real AWS, it is not reset), and reading or deleting a nonexistent shadow returns `ResourceNotFoundException`. Shadows are account-scoped and persisted with the rest of the IoT state. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **IoT — MQTT publishes are routed through topic rules to Lambda** — an MQTT/`iot-data` publish is now matched against each account's topic rules by the rule's `FROM '<topic filter>'` clause (with `+`/`#` wildcards), and every matching enabled rule's `lambda` actions are invoked asynchronously with the message payload as the event (`SELECT *`). Basic Ingest is supported: a publish to `$aws/rules/<ruleName>` is delivered straight to that rule's actions and bypasses pub/sub. Disabled rules are skipped. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **API Gateway v2 — `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Authorizer` CloudFormation support** — deploying a stack with a JWT authorizer on an HTTP API previously failed with `Unsupported resource type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Authorizer` and rolled the stack back, even though the same authorizer already worked via the raw API and Terraform. A provisioner now maps the CFN properties onto the existing authorizer store (`Ref` returns the authorizer id, `Fn::GetAtt AuthorizerId` supported, per the CFN resource reference), and `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Route` carries `AuthorizerId`/`AuthorizationScopes` through (previously dropped) so the route is actually enforced. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **RDS — Aurora cluster shared-storage model** — Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL members now share one cluster-owned database container instead of provisioning divergent per-instance databases. Writer and reader endpoints, direct connections, and the RDS Data API resolve to the same live data, so tables, users, and grants created through one member are visible through every member. Deleting the final provisioned member stops but preserves the shared container, leaving the cluster available while direct SQL and the Data API remain unavailable; attaching a new first member restarts the same container and data. Cluster deletion owns container and volume cleanup, and persisted clusters respawn one shared container on warm boot. The local reader endpoint intentionally remains read/write because it targets the same database process; engine-enforced read-only behavior would require a separate replicating process. Contributed by @Areson.

### Changed
- **EventBridge, ECS, and Firehose — region-isolated state** — continuing the multi-region work, three more services move their state to account+region scope: **EventBridge** (event buses, rules, targets, archives, replays, connections, API destinations, and endpoints; replays run under the region they were started in, and S3→EventBridge notifications dispatch in the bucket's region), **ECS** (clusters, task definitions and their revisions, services, tasks, capacity providers, account settings, and attributes), and **Firehose** (delivery streams, with Kinesis-source ingest kept within the stream's account and region). Same-name resources in different regions no longer collide, cross-region lookups return the same errors real AWS returns, and legacy persisted state migrates by recovering each record's region from its stored ARNs (ECS bumps its on-disk state format to v3). Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **Cognito — `ListUsers` `status` filter matched against the wrong field** — `Filter='status = "Enabled"'`/`"Disabled"` was compared against `UserStatus` (the confirmation-state enum: `CONFIRMED`, `FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD`, `UNCONFIRMED`, etc.), which never equals the literal string `"Enabled"`/`"Disabled"`. As a result, filtering by `status` always returned an empty list, regardless of how many users existed or their actual enabled/disabled state. `status` now correctly reflects the account's `Enabled` boolean toggled by `AdminEnableUser`/`AdminDisableUser`, matching real AWS Cognito's `ListUsers` Filter semantics. Contributed by @jey-mfv.
- **Cognito — `PreTokenGeneration` `triggerSource` reflects the call path** — every issued token reported `TokenGeneration_Authentication`; refresh flows (`REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` and the `/oauth2/token` `refresh_token` grant) now send `TokenGeneration_RefreshTokens`, and the managed-login `authorization_code` grant sends `TokenGeneration_HostedAuth`, matching the trigger-sources table in the Cognito developer guide. Contributed by @kjdev.
- **Cognito — `PreSignUp_ExternalProvider` trigger fires on federated sign-up** — SAML/OIDC federation callbacks persisted new users without ever invoking the pool's PreSignUp Lambda, which real Cognito always fires immediately before creating a federated user. The trigger now runs fail-closed (a throwing Lambda blocks the sign-up with `UserLambdaValidationException` and the user is never persisted), and its `autoVerifyEmail`/`autoVerifyPhone` overrides are applied to the created user. Federated users keep `UserStatus: EXTERNAL_PROVIDER` as on real AWS (`autoConfirmUser` does not change a federated user's status). Contributed by @kjdev.
- **EventBridge Pipes — cross-region source or target rejected** — a pipe whose source or target ARN is in a different region than the pipe is now rejected before any state is written (surfaced through CloudFormation as `CREATE_FAILED`), matching AWS, where a pipe's source and target are same-region. Global and malformed ARNs are still accepted as before. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Lambda — Node warm-worker invoke no longer fails on fd 1 writes** — `fs.writeSync` / `fs.write` on stdout bypassed the existing `process.stdout.write` redirect to stderr, so sync loggers (e.g. pino with `{ sync: true }`) could emit on the JSON-line protocol channel and surface false `Runtime.HandlerError` / `Unknown error` responses even when the handler succeeded. The Node worker bootstrap now redirects fd 1 through `fs.writeSync` / `fs.write`, and the warm-worker stdout reader accepts only protocol lines whose `status` is `ok` or `error`. Contributed by @vvaide. Reported by @kofuk.
- **Lambda — `X-Amz-Log-Result` honors `LogType`** — the execution-log header was attached to every synchronous invoke; per the Invoke API reference it is returned only when `LogType=Tail`, carrying the last 4 KB of the execution log base64-encoded. Both now match. Contributed by @Sanjays2402. Reported by @w-zx.
- **Lambda — event source mappings pace failed-invoke retries per ESM** — a failing ESM was retried at full poll-loop speed whenever another busy ESM kept the loop awake, and a burst on a healthy ESM was throttled to one batch per tick. The poll loop now keeps draining while work is being processed and each failing ESM backs off independently; failure semantics are unchanged (SQS messages redrive after the visibility timeout, stream shards retry the same batch). Contributed by @squirmy.
- **S3 — a versioned delete with an explicit `VersionId` permanently removes that version** — `DeleteObject` and `DeleteObjects` addressed with a `VersionId` reported success but never touched the version store, so `ListObjectVersions` still returned every version and delete marker (`DeleteObject` even appended a *new* marker, driving the count up). Both paths now purge the exact version/marker and reconcile the current version; a delete *without* a `VersionId` still creates a delete marker as before. Contributed by @asleeponduty.
- **S3 — versioned object reads preserve `Content-Type`** — `GetObject` with a `VersionId` always returned `application/octet-stream`, even when that version was written with an explicit content type. PutObject version records now retain their own content type, and versioned reads return it while preserving the existing fallback for older records. Contributed by @vvaide. Reported by @aaronsteed.
- **S3 — `CreateBucket` applies and validates request-body `Tags`** — the `<Tags>` container in a `CreateBucket` body was ignored (only `LocationConstraint` was parsed), so tags supplied at creation were silently dropped and a follow-up `GetBucketTagging` returned `NoSuchTagSet` while S3 Control `ListTagsForResource` returned an empty list. Create-time tags are now stored and returned by both, validated before the bucket is created (key 1-128 chars, value 0-256, the reserved `aws:` prefix rejected with `InvalidTag`, at most 50 tags, and a duplicate key returns a `500 InternalError`); an invalid tag set leaves no bucket behind. Contributed by @nirajsapkota.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- **IoT — `AWS::IoT::TopicRule` CloudFormation support** — deploying an `AWS::IoT::TopicRule` previously failed with `Unsupported resource type: AWS::IoT::TopicRule` and rolled the stack back. A provisioner now creates and deletes the rule (normalizing the PascalCase `TopicRulePayload` — `Sql`, `Actions`, `Lambda`/`FunctionArn`, … — to the API's camelCase shape), `Ref` returns the rule name and `Fn::GetAtt Arn` the rule ARN. The IoT control plane gains the backing operations: `CreateTopicRule`, `GetTopicRule`, `ListTopicRules`, `ReplaceTopicRule`, and `DeleteTopicRule`. Rules are account-scoped and persisted with the rest of the IoT state. Contributed by @maximoosemine.

### Changed
- **SNS, Kinesis, KMS, and ElastiCache — region-isolated state** — continuing the 1.4.0 multi-region work, four more services move their state to account+region scope: **SNS** (topics, subscriptions, platform applications, platform endpoints), **Kinesis** (streams, shard iterators — which now also survive a warm boot, still subject to their 5-minute expiry — and enhanced-fan-out consumers), **KMS** (keys and aliases — the same alias name can now target different keys per region, as on AWS), and **ElastiCache** (clusters, replication groups, subnet/parameter groups, snapshots, users, user groups, and events; local Redis/Memcached container names now carry the account and region so same-name clusters coexist across regions). Same-name resources in different regions no longer collide, cross-region lookups return the same errors real AWS returns, and background pollers process each resource under its own account and region. Legacy persisted state migrates by recovering each record's region from its stored ARNs; records without an ARN migrate to the default region (`MINISTACK_REGION`). Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **DynamoDB — validation parity with real AWS on reads, deletes, batches, and transactions** — validation gaps that let malformed requests succeed silently (all verified against **real AWS DynamoDB**): (1) `GetItem`, `DeleteItem`, and `BatchGetItem` now reject key attributes carrying an empty string/binary value, as `PutItem` already did; (2) `BatchWriteItem` validates every member *before* applying any — previously a bad member returned the correct `ValidationException` but earlier members were already written; (3) `TransactWriteItems` validates every member before applying anything and matches real AWS's two failure shapes: an empty-string/binary key value (or malformed item) is an up-front top-level `ValidationException`, whereas a wrong-typed key or an update-expression type error is surfaced as a `TransactionCanceledException` with a positional `ValidationError` cancellation reason — previously an invalid member was silently committed with no error at all; (4) `Query` rejects a `KeyConditionExpression` `BETWEEN` with inverted bounds at parse time with the AWS error message, instead of returning an empty result; (5) `Query` validates key-condition operands like key values — an empty string/binary operand on a key attribute is rejected; (6) `Query` rejects an `ExclusiveStartKey` whose sort value violates the range-key predicate (`The provided starting key does not match the range key predicate`) — such a cursor can never have been issued by a previous page; (7) `UpdateItem` `SET` rejects a document path that doesn't resolve on the item (`The provided expression refers to an attribute that does not exist in the item`) — e.g. `list_append` on a missing attribute, where `if_not_exists` is the sanctioned form; previously the assignment was silently skipped; (8) `UpdateItem` `ADD`/`DELETE` reject non-Number/Set operands (`Incorrect operand type for operator or function`, with the AWS quirk that the `typeSet` is reported as `ALLOWED_FOR_ADD_OPERAND` even for `DELETE`) and operands whose type doesn't match the existing attribute (`An operand in the update expression has an incorrect data type`) — previously `ADD` could silently *replace* a set attribute with a number, and `DELETE` silently no-opped. All error shapes verified against real AWS DynamoDB. Contributed by @ifutivic.
- **DynamoDB — `Query`/`Scan` return `LastEvaluatedKey` when results end exactly at `Limit`** — real DynamoDB doesn't look ahead: whenever it stops because of the limit it returns a `LastEvaluatedKey`, even if nothing remains, and the follow-up page comes back empty with no key. MiniStack only returned the key when strictly more items remained, so SDK pagination helpers that rely on the exact-limit page (e.g. "has more pages" checks) diverged from AWS. Verified against DynamoDB Local. Contributed by @ifutivic.
- **Step Functions — `aws-sdk:lambda` write actions** — `createFunction`, `updateFunctionConfiguration`, `updateFunctionCode`, `createAlias`, and `updateAlias` now dispatch through the Lambda REST emulator (previously they failed with `States.Runtime: not yet implemented`; only `getAlias` and `getFunctionConfiguration` were covered). The SFN SDK-convention `KmsKeyArn` parameter is mapped to Lambda's wire-form `KMSKeyArn` so it's honored instead of silently ignored, task output keys use the same SFN casing convention as the other dispatchers, and Lambda errors surface with prefixed codes so `Catch` clauses match. Contributed by @Areson.
- **API Gateway v2 — WebSocket `$connect` invokes JWT authorizers** — a JWT authorizer configured on the `$connect` route was ignored, so any client could connect without a token. The route's authorizer is now validated exactly like the HTTP API path — missing or invalid tokens close the connection with code 1008, and validated claims and scopes are injected into `requestContext.authorizer.jwt` for the integration. Reported by @Lukasdoe.
- **S3 — versioned `GetObject` returns the body after a restart with `S3_PERSIST=1`** — object-version records live in memory only, so after a restart a `GetObject` with `versionId` (for the id restored via the 1.4.1 metadata sidecar) found a version record with no data and returned an empty body. Restore now seeds the current version from the on-disk sidecar, and versioned reads fall back to the persisted object body on disk. Reported by @adzcodemi.
- **SQS — XML error responses carry the legacy query-protocol error codes** — the query-protocol (XML) error path emitted the modern JSON-protocol code in `<Code>` (e.g. `QueueDoesNotExist`), but SDKs speaking the legacy query protocol match on the namespaced codes (e.g. `AWS.SimpleQueueService.NonExistentQueue`) — the same `awsQueryCompatible` mapping already sent in the `x-amzn-query-error` header on the JSON path is now applied to the XML `<Code>` element. Reported by @play4uman.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- **EKS — clusters pull images from local ECR** — every k3s cluster now boots with an auto-generated `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` that mirrors the cluster's ECR registry hostname (`<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com`) to the MiniStack gateway, so `kubectl run --image <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/repo:tag` pulls an image you pushed to local ECR — no manual registry wiring. The mirror endpoint is MiniStack's own address on the shared Docker network when one is detected, and `host.docker.internal` (added to the k3s container via `host-gateway`) when MiniStack runs on the host. Verified end-to-end: image pushed to local ECR, pod pulled and reached `Running`. Reported by @L3337.
- **RDS — Aurora MySQL version-to-image mapping and MySQL 8.4 support** — Aurora MySQL containers now boot the MySQL image matching the requested engine version track (5.7 / 8.0 / 8.4) instead of the floating `mysql:8` tag, which had started silently booting MySQL 8.4 for Aurora MySQL 8.0 test cases. `DescribeDBEngineVersions` returns the full creatable Aurora MySQL catalog with correct per-family parameter groups — including the new `8.4.mysql_aurora.8.4.7` / `aurora-mysql8.4` (GA 2026-05-21) — an explicit `EngineVersion` not in the catalog is rejected with the AWS error shape, and `aurora-mysql8.4` parameter-group defaults omit `skip-character-set-client-handshake` (removed in MySQL 8.4) while older families keep it. The default Aurora MySQL version moves from the no-longer-creatable `8.0.mysql_aurora.3.03.0` to `8.0.mysql_aurora.3.10.3`. Contributed by @Areson.

### Changed
- **EventBridge Pipes — region-isolated state** — pipe records and stream positions move to account+region scope (continuing the 1.4.0 multi-region work), so same-name pipes in different regions no longer collide, and the background poller processes each pipe under its own account and region. Legacy persisted state migrates by recovering each pipe's region from its ARN. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Docker images — Python 3.13 base** — both images (`Dockerfile` Alpine and `Dockerfile.full` Debian) move from `python:3.12` to `python:3.13`, clearing the CPython 3.12 interpreter CVEs flagged by image scanners; CI now runs the test suite on 3.13 to match the shipped interpreter. `Dockerfile.full` also runs `apt-get upgrade` so Debian base packages pick up security patches on every rebuild, as its comment always claimed and as the Alpine image already did. Contributed by @scottschreckengaust.

### Fixed
- **Lambda — concurrent `provided.*` invocations no longer fail with `ETXTBSY` ("Text file busy")** — each invocation extracted the function zip into its own temp directory and exec'd the `bootstrap` binary from it; while one thread still held the extraction's write descriptor, another thread's process spawn let the child inherit it, and executing the binary failed with `ETXTBSY` (a classic CPython fork/exec race). Extraction is now content-addressed — one shared read-only directory per code sha256, matching real Lambda's read-only `/var/task` — and spawns are serialized against extraction so the race cannot occur. Reported by @crestonbunch.
- **Lambda — `provided.*` runtime env restores `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION`, and `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME`** — 1.4.0's reserved-name filtering stripped these from the user environment, and the provided-runtime executor (unlike the container, local, and warm-worker paths) never re-injected them from the function config, so the Rust `lambda_runtime` crate — which requires `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE` — crashed on startup. All three are now set from the function configuration, matching the other executors and real AWS. Reported by @crestonbunch.
- **Lambda — SQS event source mappings deliver `messageAttributes` in camelCase** — records forwarded to functions carried the PascalCase inner keys SQS uses on the wire (`StringValue`/`DataType`/`BinaryValue`), but real Lambda re-serializes them to camelCase (`stringValue`/`dataType`/…) before invoking. Typed handler bindings — e.g. Java's `SQSEvent.MessageAttribute`, which Jackson populates case-strictly — saw all-null attributes and failed on messages whose attributes were set correctly. The ESM now performs the same camelCase transformation as AWS at the delivery boundary; the SQS API surface itself is unchanged. Reported by @w-zx.
- **S3 — `versionId` survives payload persistence to a volume** — with `S3_PERSIST=1`, the on-disk `.meta.json` sidecar never recorded the object's `version_id`, and all four write paths (PutObject, POST upload, CopyObject, CompleteMultipartUpload) persisted the sidecar *before* the version id was assigned — so after a restart, GET/HEAD returned no `x-amz-version-id` for objects on the volume. The sidecar now stores the version id and is written after version assignment, so the current version id of every object survives restarts. (Historical version data is still memory-only; full version-history persistence is tracked separately.) Reported by @adzcodemi.
- **Cognito — `ListUsers` parses quoted attribute names in `Filter`** — the filter parser only matched unquoted attribute names, but AWS's documented syntax also accepts the quoted form (`"email" = "value"` — used in AWS's own API-reference sample request), and on any parse failure MiniStack silently returned **all** users. Both forms now parse (including the docs' no-space `"email"^="value"` shape), and an unparseable filter logs a warning. Contributed by @kjdev.

## [1.4.0] "Areson" — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Multi-region support** — resource state is now isolated per account *and* region. The request region is taken from the SigV4 credential scope (Authorization header or presigned `X-Amz-Credential` query parameter), so two clients pointed at different regions see fully independent state, matching real AWS. Region-isolated in this release: AppConfig, Bedrock, Bedrock Agent, Bedrock Agent Runtime, Bedrock Runtime, CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, DynamoDB (tables, metadata, and Streams), Lambda (functions, event source mappings, durable executions), MSK, RDS, S3 Tables, Secrets Manager, SQS, SSM Parameter Store, and Step Functions. Cross-resource references resolve in the referenced ARN's own account and region (SNS→SQS fanout, EventBridge targets, ESM sources), background workers (event source pollers, the EventBridge scheduler tick, durable-function resume) re-scope to each resource's tenant, and ARNs are parsed and validated everywhere — cross-region references that real AWS rejects now return the same errors AWS returns. Persisted state moves to an on-disk format v2 with a version stamp (a newer-format file is refused instead of mis-parsed on downgrade); legacy account-scoped state files load and migrate automatically, recovering each record's region from its stored ARNs. Services not listed above keep sharing state across regions within an account, exactly as in 1.3.x — region isolation for them lands in subsequent releases. Note for `PERSIST_STATE` users: legacy records that carry no ARN migrate to the default region (`MINISTACK_REGION`), so pre-1.4 state created with a client region different from `MINISTACK_REGION` in a non-ARN service reads back under the default region. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Amazon Bedrock — four new services** — the full local Bedrock surface: **bedrock** control plane (66 operations verified against botocore — foundation-model catalog with real model IDs, inference profiles, guardrails with versioning, custom and imported models, provisioned throughput, and the customization / import / copy / batch-invocation job families), **bedrock-runtime** (`Converse`, `ConverseStream`, `InvokeModel`, `InvokeModelWithResponseStream` with real eventstream wire format, `ApplyGuardrail`, and async invokes — deterministic family-aware mock responses selected by model ID prefix for Anthropic, Titan, Nova, Llama, Mistral, Cohere, and AI21 shapes), **bedrock-agent** (72 operations — agents, knowledge bases, data sources, ingestion jobs, flows, prompts, tags), and **bedrock-agent-runtime** (31 operations — `InvokeAgent`, `Retrieve`/`RetrieveAndGenerate`, reranking, sessions, flow executions, prompt optimization). Led by @dcabib.
- **Amazon MSK** — Kafka control plane: cluster lifecycle (`CreateCluster`, `ListClusters`, `DescribeCluster`, `DeleteCluster`, `ListNodes`), configurations with revisions, SCRAM secret association, and tagging. `GetBootstrapBrokers` honors `MINISTACK_MSK_BOOTSTRAP` so clients route to a real broker you bring (Redpanda, Kafka, KRaft) while the control plane stays emulated; the Kafka wire protocol itself is not emulated.

## [1.3.72] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **EC2 — placement group actions** — `CreatePlacementGroup`, `DeletePlacementGroup`, and `DescribePlacementGroups` are implemented (they previously failed with `InvalidAction: Unknown EC2 action`), so `aws_placement_group` in Terraform/CDK creates, reads, and deletes against MiniStack. Groups are account-scoped and tagged like every other EC2 resource (`pg-` ids, `CreateTags`/`DescribeTags`, and `tag:` / `group-name` / `state` / `strategy` filters), duplicate names return `InvalidPlacementGroup.Duplicate` and unknown names return `InvalidPlacementGroup.Unknown`, and `partitionCount` is emitted only for the `partition` strategy — matching real EC2. Contributed by @c-julin.
- **Auto Scaling — groups report in-service instances so capacity waiters converge** — `CreateAutoScalingGroup`, `UpdateAutoScalingGroup`, and a newly handled `SetDesiredCapacity` now materialize `DesiredCapacity` mock instances (`InService` / `Healthy`, round-robined across the group's Availability Zones), and `DescribeAutoScalingGroups` / `DescribeAutoScalingInstances` report them. Previously a group reported zero instances forever, so Terraform's `aws_autoscaling_group` capacity waiter blocked for the full `wait_for_capacity_timeout` and then failed on every apply; it now converges. Contributed by @c-julin.

### Fixed
- **Router — access key extraction from presigned-URL query parameters** — the per-request account (multi-tenancy) and CloudTrail attribution were read only from the `Authorization` header, so a presigned S3 URL created under a non-default account resolved to the default account and returned 404 on the bucket lookup. The access key is now also extracted from the SigV4 `X-Amz-Credential` and SigV2 `AWSAccessKeyId` query parameters, matching how AWS honors query-string credentials as a general signing mechanism. Contributed by @neriyaco.
- **EKS — OIDC issuer scheme follows the gateway protocol** — the cluster OIDC issuer advertised by `DescribeCluster` and the discovery document was hardcoded to `http`, so Terraform's `aws_iam_openid_connect_provider`, which client-side rejects non-https urls, failed at plan time. The scheme now derives from `USE_SSL`: `https` when the gateway serves TLS, `http` otherwise, so the advertised issuer matches what MiniStack actually serves and IRSA Terraform applies against a TLS gateway.
- **DynamoDB — `UpdateItem` validates values, and `UPDATED_NEW` / `UPDATED_OLD` match AWS** — `UpdateItem` now runs the same attribute and item-size validation as `PutItem` (it skipped it before), and `UPDATED_NEW` / `UPDATED_OLD` report every attribute the update expression touched — including a `SET` that assigns the same value, which was previously omitted as a no-op and diverged from AWS. String-set validation no longer rejects empty-string members. Contributed by @chincharjuin.

## [1.3.71] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **EventBridge Scheduler — standalone schedules now fire their targets** — a background sweep evaluates each `ENABLED` schedule and invokes its target when due, so `aws_scheduler_schedule` resources actually deliver instead of being stored inert. Supports `at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss)` one-time, `rate(...)`, and `cron(...)` expressions; honors `State`, `StartDate`/`EndDate`, and `ActionAfterCompletion: DELETE` (one-shot cleanup after a fired `at()` schedule); and dispatches to Lambda, SQS, SNS, and Step Functions targets, reusing the EventBridge rule dispatch so behavior matches the rules path. `FlexibleTimeWindow` fires at the nominal time. Reported by @BarkinBalci.
- **Lambda — event source mappings accept and persist `ScalingConfig` (`MaximumConcurrency`)** — `CreateEventSourceMapping` and `UpdateEventSourceMapping` now accept a `ScalingConfig` block and echo it back on create, `GetEventSourceMapping`, and `ListEventSourceMappings`, so the SQS-trigger `scaling_config { maximum_concurrency = N }` on the Terraform `aws_lambda_event_source_mapping` resource round-trips instead of being silently dropped (which surfaced as a perpetual plan diff). `MaximumConcurrency` outside the AWS-valid 2–1000 range is rejected with `ValidationException`; `ScalingConfig` is honored only for Amazon SQS event sources (rejected with `InvalidParameterValueException` on any non-SQS source, matching AWS), and a non-integer `MaximumConcurrency` is rejected as a validation error rather than causing a 500. `BatchSize` and `MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds` were already supported. Contributed by @liammizrahi.
- **Organizations — `ListParents` + tag ops for the OU Terraform round-trip** — adds `ListParents(ChildId)` (returns the single parent AWS reports — `{"Parents": [{"Id", "Type"}]}`, `Type=ROOT` for the org root else `ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT` — from the `_ParentId` already stored on every OU and account; unknown `ChildId` → `ChildNotFoundException`) **and** `TagResource` / `UntagResource` / `ListTagsForResource` for taggable org resources. The Terraform/OpenTofu `aws_organizations_organizational_unit` Read calls **both** `ListParents` (to populate `parent_id`, which `DescribeOrganizationalUnit` omits) and `ListTagsForResource` on every create + refresh — even for an untagged OU. With either missing, `apply` hard-stops on the read-back (`InvalidAction: Operation '<op>' not implemented`), so a multi-OU hierarchy never finished creating and was never idempotent; with both, it applies cleanly and re-applies as a no-op. No new state. Contributed by @b-rajesh.

### Fixed
- **CloudTrail — `CreateTrail` persists `KmsKeyId`** — `CreateTrail` accepted `KmsKeyId` but dropped it (only `UpdateTrail` stored it), so `DescribeTrails`/`GetTrail` read it back empty and Terraform's `aws_cloudtrail` did not converge in a single apply: the first `plan` after `apply` showed a `kms_key_id` diff that only cleared on a second apply (via `UpdateTrail`). `CreateTrail` now stores and returns `KmsKeyId`, normalized to a full key ARN as real AWS echoes it (a bare key id is expanded; an ARN or `alias/...` is kept), and omits the field when no CMK is set so an unset trail shows no diff. `UpdateTrail` normalizes it the same way and likewise omits it from its response when unset. Contributed by @b-rajesh.
- **S3 — `GetObject` returns `x-amz-tagging-count` (`TagCount`)** — `GetObject` now reports the object's tag count via the `x-amz-tagging-count` response header (surfaced by SDKs as `TagCount`), present only when the object carries at least one tag and omitted otherwise, matching AWS. Previously the header was never sent, so boto3 and the AWS SDK for C++ reported no `TagCount` for a tagged object. Reported by @vschreiner.
- **API Gateway v2 — `rawQueryString` stays percent-encoded** — the payload-format-2.0 proxy event's `rawQueryString` was rebuilt from URL-decoded query parameters, so `%20` became a literal space (and a decoded `=`/`&` inside a value corrupted the query structure). Rust functions on `lambda_http` — which build the request URI from `rawQueryString` — rejected the space with `InvalidUriChar` and returned 502. Each key and value is now re-encoded, so `rawQueryString` matches AWS and SDKs parse it correctly. Reported by @crestonbunch.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Lambda::EventSourceMapping` round-trips all optional properties and updates in place** — a CloudFormation-created mapping previously kept only `FilterCriteria` and silently dropped `DestinationConfig`, `ParallelizationFactor`, `MaximumRetryAttempts`, `MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds`, `BisectBatchOnFunctionError`, and `ScalingConfig`, causing perpetual Terraform/CDK diffs; all are now preserved on create. A stack update that changes the mapping now mutates it in place (same physical id), matching `UpdateEventSourceMapping`, instead of re-running create and leaking a duplicate mapping that double-invoked the function; an immutable change (`EventSourceArn`/`StartingPosition`) is a proper replacement. Contributed by @maximoosemine.

---

## [1.3.70] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **CloudFormation — SAM transform (`AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31`) templates are expanded into native CloudFormation** — a template carrying `Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31` now has its SAM resources expanded into native CloudFormation before provisioning, via the canonical `aws-sam-translator`, matching AWS's server-side expansion on `CreateStack`, `UpdateStack`, and `CreateChangeSet`. The dependency is optional and ships in the full image only; a lean image that receives a SAM template returns a clear error pointing to the full image instead of silently failing to expand. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **IAM — group policy attach/detach and inline group policies** — `AttachGroupPolicy`, `DetachGroupPolicy`, `ListAttachedGroupPolicies`, `PutGroupPolicy`, `GetGroupPolicy`, `DeleteGroupPolicy`, and `ListGroupPolicies` are now implemented, matching the existing User and Role coverage, so the create-group then attach-managed-and-inline-policy pattern works instead of returning `InvalidAction: Unknown IAM action`. Contributed by @maxflorentin.
- **SNS — mobile-push endpoint lifecycle: `GetEndpointAttributes`, `SetEndpointAttributes`, `DeleteEndpoint`, `DeletePlatformApplication`** — completes the platform-endpoint flow on top of the existing `CreatePlatformApplication`/`CreatePlatformEndpoint`. `CreatePlatformEndpoint` now dedups by device token within a platform application (AWS behavior): re-requesting the same `Token` returns the existing endpoint ARN when `CustomUserData` matches, and raises `InvalidParameter` `"Endpoint <arn> already exists with the same Token, but different attributes."` when it differs — so callers can parse the ARN and reconcile. `Publish` to a platform-endpoint `TargetArn` now succeeds (stub delivery) instead of returning `Topic does not exist`, and `DeletePlatformApplication` is idempotent and drops the application's endpoints. This lets app push-token registration flows (register → read/update attributes → delete) run end-to-end against MiniStack. Contributed by @sjincho.

### Fixed
- **S3 — S3 → EventBridge events use AWS-conformant `detail-type`, `reason`, and `deletion-type`** — S3 → EventBridge delivery built the `detail-type` by string-mangling the granular notification event name (`Object ObjectCreated Put` instead of AWS's fixed `Object Created`), hardcoded `detail.reason` to `PutObject` for every event, and omitted `detail.deletion-type` on deletes. Because EventBridge rules match on `detail-type`, any rule written to the AWS-documented type (e.g. `["Object Created"]`) silently never matched. Each S3 event family now maps to its fixed EventBridge `detail-type`, with the per-API `reason` (`PutObject`/`POST Object`/`CopyObject`/`CompleteMultipartUpload`/`DeleteObject`) and a `deletion-type` on `Object Deleted`. Contributed by @lucasmfraser.
- **API Gateway — failed OIDC discovery is negative-cached so a transient failure no longer causes a 2 hour auth outage** — `_fetch_oidc_jwks_uri` cached the result of OIDC discovery unconditionally, so a single transient failure cached `jwks_uri = None` for the full 7200s TTL and every subsequent JWT validation for that issuer fell back to the wrong default path and returned 401/404 for up to two hours, recoverable only by a restart. Discovery now writes the 7200s cache only on success and a short 60s negative cache on failure, so auth recovers within a minute of the issuer becoming reachable while still avoiding a re-run on every request. Contributed by @Pratham2703005.
- **Lambda — worker respawn cleans up the previous tmpdir and terminates the dead process** — when a Lambda worker died between invocations, `_spawn()` created a fresh tmpdir without removing the previous one (leaking the extracted function code and layers on disk) and an errored handler set `self._proc = None` without terminating the subprocess (leaking ~68 MB per orphaned worker). Respawn now removes the old tmpdir and terminates the previous process first. Contributed by @hiddengearz.
- **Cognito — OAuth2 Basic-auth client secret containing `+` is no longer corrupted** — the `Authorization: Basic` credential decode used `unquote_plus`, which turns a literal `+` in a Cognito-generated secret into a space, so `client_secret_basic` failed with `invalid_client` for the roughly half of generated secrets that contain a `+`. It now uses `unquote`, preserving `+` while still decoding `%2F`/`%2B`. Contributed by @jgrumboe.

## [1.3.69] — 2026-06-27


### Fixed
- **EKS — `DescribeCluster` returns a host-reachable endpoint on every path** — `DescribeCluster` now advertises the host-published port, `https://{MINISTACK_HOST}:{port}` (`MINISTACK_HOST` defaults to `localhost`), uniformly on cluster create, OIDC-config restart, and persistence restore. Previously the failure-fallback and restore paths could leave a stale value, so `aws eks update-kubeconfig` + kubectl from the host got an unreachable endpoint. The k3s container publishes 6443 to that host port (`ports={"6443/tcp": port}`), so the endpoint works from the host and from containers that can route to `MINISTACK_HOST`, keeping the `ACTIVE`-cluster shape consistent for `aws eks update-kubeconfig` and Terraform. Contributed by @b-rajesh.
- **SQS — `SendMessage` rejects message bodies with XML 1.0 forbidden characters** — AWS SQS only accepts characters valid in XML 1.0 and returns `InvalidMessageContents` for anything else; MiniStack silently accepted them, so a payload that fails against real AWS passed locally. `SendMessage` (and every `SendMessageBatch` entry) now rejects bodies containing C0 control characters other than tab/LF/CR, the surrogate block `#xD800`–`#xDFFF`, and `#xFFFE`/`#xFFFF` with `InvalidMessageContents`. Contributed by @yamachu.

## [1.3.68] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- **Cognito — OAuth2 token endpoint URL-decodes HTTP Basic client credentials** — a `client_secret` containing `/` or `+` arrives in the `Authorization: Basic` header as `%2F`/`%2B` (RFC 6749 §2.3.1 form-urlencodes the client id and secret before base64). MiniStack did not decode them, so `client_secret_basic` failed with `invalid_client` for any secret with special characters. The credentials are now decoded, matching the `client_secret_post` path. Reported by @pny-nc.
- **Step Functions — `lambda:invoke.waitForTaskToken` delivers the unwrapped `Payload`** — the callback path forwarded the whole service-integration envelope (`{"FunctionName": ..., "Payload": {...}}`) to the Lambda instead of just the `Payload`, unlike the synchronous `lambda:invoke` path. A handler reading its task token / input from the top level saw them nested under `Payload`, never resumed the task, and the execution hung until timeout. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **Step Functions — a failed `lambda:invoke` task sets `Cause` to a JSON-encoded error payload** — `Cause` was the bare `errorMessage` string instead of AWS's JSON object (`{"errorType": ..., "errorMessage": ..., "trace": [...]}`), so `Catch` handlers and downstream tasks that `json.loads(Cause)` to read `errorType`/`errorMessage` failed to parse it. `Cause` now matches the AWS wire form. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.
- **SNS — `lambda` subscribers are delivered to asynchronously** — fanout invoked a `lambda`-protocol subscriber synchronously inside `Publish`, so a slow or hung subscriber Lambda blocked the `Publish` call and its upstream caller (e.g. a Step Functions task publishing a notification). Delivery now runs on a background thread, matching AWS's asynchronous SNS→Lambda delivery, so `Publish` returns immediately. Contributed by @ryan-bennett.

---

## [1.3.67] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **CloudFormation / API Gateway — `AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi` imports an OpenAPI `Body`** — a REST API defined inline through the `Body` property now materializes its paths, methods, and `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` blocks as real resources, methods, and integrations, covering the basic SAM-transform Swagger 2.0 + Lambda-proxy shape. Partial support; authorization, request/response validation, and most extensions are not yet handled. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **EC2 — IAM instance profile association APIs** — `AssociateIamInstanceProfile`, `DescribeIamInstanceProfileAssociations`, `ReplaceIamInstanceProfileAssociation`, and `DisassociateIamInstanceProfile` are now implemented; launch-time associations are backfilled and cleared on termination, so Terraform's `aws_instance` `iam_instance_profile` round-trips without drift. Contributed by @D-artisan.

### Changed
- **Docs — clarified that the AWS SAM transform macro is not supported** — `Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31` is not expanded, so a SAM template still needs the CDK/CloudFormation-synthesized form; the README now points to the IaC docs and MiniStack MCP for current guidance. Contributed by @dashitongzhi.

### Fixed
- **Cognito — OAuth2 token endpoint no longer consumes the authorization code on a failed client-secret check** — a bad or absent client secret consumed the one-time code before failing, so a client that authenticates in two steps (HTTP Basic, then a `client_secret_post` fallback, as Go/Vault does) got `invalid_grant` on the retry. The client credentials are now validated before the code is consumed, so HTTP Basic client authentication succeeds. Reported by @pny-nc.
- **API Gateway v1 — literal path segments resolve ahead of a `{param}` sibling regardless of creation order** — a literal path (e.g. `/users/verifyUserEmail`) returned 405 when a `{id}` sibling under the same parent was registered first, because resolution followed resource-creation order instead of AWS specificity. Resolution now orders literal > `{param}` > `{proxy+}`. Reported by @ethan-dyas438.
- **RDS Data API — `:name` placeholders are substituted by whole token** — the earlier substring replacement could corrupt an unrelated longer token (a `:id` parameter ate into a literal `:identity`) and was fragile around `::type` casts. Substitution is now a single token-aware pass, keeping `:1`/`:10` distinct, leaving `::jsonb` casts intact, and passing through any `:word` that is not a supplied parameter. Reported by @awilson9.

---

## [1.3.66] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **ElastiCache — broad parity improvements** — built-in `default.*` parameter groups for the Redis, Memcached, and Valkey families (including `.cluster.on` variants) with AWS-style engine-version→family mapping; seeded defaults are immutable (create/modify/delete/reset rejected with AWS-shaped errors); replication-group creation materializes member cache clusters with metadata, tags, and member IDs and removes them on deletion; create/modify validate user groups with `UserGroupNotFound`; tag updates fan out to member cluster ARNs; and ElastiCache is now covered by the Resource Groups Tagging API. User and user-group error codes now use AWS's wire forms (`UserNotFound`, `UserGroupNotFound`, …). Contributed by @ZiningYin.
- **IAM — additional AWS-managed policies seeded** — `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess`, `AWSXrayReadOnlyAccess`, and `AWSLambdaRole` are now pre-seeded with their canonical documents, so Terraform's tracing lookup (`data "aws_iam_policy" { arn = ".../AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess" }`, used by every `attach_tracing_policy = true` module) resolves. Contributed by @mattwang44.

### Changed
- **CI — test suite now runs as balanced parallel shards** — the workflow plans shards from a per-file test-count map and runs them across separate runners, with a dedicated serial phase for global-state tests, cutting CI wall-clock time. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **Build — bumped `github.com/containerd/containerd` 1.7.32 → 1.7.33** in the Go Testcontainers helper module.

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation — `aws cloudformation deploy` without `--parameter-overrides` now updates resources** — a change set created with `UsePreviousValue=true` (what `deploy` sends for existing parameters when no overrides are given) resolved the parameter to an empty value instead of its stored value, so a parameter-driven resource name (e.g. `!Sub ${StackName}-handler`) resolved wrong and the stack update silently missed the real resource — its code/properties never changed. `UsePreviousValue` is now resolved against the stack's stored parameters on both the change-set and `UpdateStack` paths. Reported by @ankitaabad.
- **Step Functions — `.waitForTaskToken` now invokes non-Lambda service integrations** — `arn:aws:states:::sqs:sendMessage.waitForTaskToken` (and `sns:publish`, `dynamodb:*`, `aws-sdk:*`, …) scheduled the task but never performed the integration, so the payload carrying the task token was never sent and the execution hung. The callback path now dispatches the integration before blocking, and an object `MessageBody` is JSON-serialized for SQS. Reported by @taylor1791.
- **RDS Data API — PostgreSQL correctness fixes** — psycopg2 connections now autocommit (matching the MySQL path), so a non-transactional `ExecuteStatement` is no longer rolled back on connection close; named parameters are substituted longest-first so `:1` no longer corrupts `:10` / `:18`; and `jsonb` values are returned as their stored JSON text instead of an invalid single-quoted Python repr. Reported by @awilson9.
- **Cognito — token/session invalidation now takes effect** — `RevokeToken`, `GlobalSignOut`, and `AdminUserGlobalSignOut` were no-ops, so a revoked refresh token still minted new access tokens. They now invalidate the affected refresh tokens, and the `REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` flow honours the revocation.
- **RDS — `CreateDBInstance` / `CreateDBCluster` validate parameter-group existence** — referencing a non-existent custom parameter group now returns `DBParameterGroupNotFound` / `DBClusterParameterGroupNotFound` instead of silently succeeding.
- **Athena — `GetTableMetadata` / `ListTableMetadata` return real columns and partition keys** — the responses were empty stubs; they now surface the backing Glue table's columns and partition keys.
- **SNS — `Publish` now accepts non-string `Message` values** — Step Functions' `arn:aws:states:::sns:publish` integration can pass `Message` as structured data rather than a plain string; it is now JSON-serialized before delivery instead of failing. Contributed by @noynoy83.

---

## [1.3.65] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **EC2 — source security groups (`UserIdGroupPairs`) now returned by `DescribeSecurityGroupRules` / `DescribeSecurityGroups`** — `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`/`Egress` rules that reference another security group were dropped at ingestion and never surfaced: `DescribeSecurityGroupRules` omitted `ReferencedGroupInfo` and `DescribeSecurityGroups` returned an empty `<groups>`. Source-group pairs are now parsed and emitted by both. Reported by @kamegoro. Contributed by @kurok.
- **Auto Scaling — instance refresh actions implemented** — `StartInstanceRefresh`, `DescribeInstanceRefreshes`, and `CancelInstanceRefresh` previously failed with `InvalidAction: Unknown AutoScaling action`. They are now handled and recorded on the Auto Scaling group, so a refresh can be started, polled, and cancelled. Contributed by @c-julin.
- **S3 — `GetBucketOwnershipControls` now 404s after delete** — it always returned a default ownership block (HTTP 200), so `DeleteBucketOwnershipControls` was not observable and Terraform's delete waiter looped (`found resource`), blocking `terraform destroy`. It now returns `OwnershipControlsNotFoundError` (404) once controls have been deleted, while still reporting the default Object Ownership for a never-configured bucket. Contributed by @c-julin.
- **Glue — `GetUserDefinedFunctions` accepts `java.util.regex` `\Q…\E` patterns** — real AWS compiles `Pattern` with `java.util.regex`, so clients like Trino's Glue connector send literal-quoted patterns (e.g. `trino__\Qname\E__.*`); Python's `re` rejected `\Q…\E` with `InvalidInputException: Invalid pattern syntax`. The literal-quote sequences are now translated before matching. Contributed by @yonatoasis.
- **API Gateway v2 — CloudFormation provisioner honours the `ms-custom-id` tag** — `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api` resources always got a random API id, ignoring an `ms-custom-id` tag in the template even though the direct `CreateApi` path and the v1 REST provisioner already honoured it. The v2 provisioner now resolves the custom id before falling back to a generated one. Contributed by @hiddengearz.
- **Lambda — function code stored as content-addressed blob files** — `get_state` base64-encoded every `code_zip` inline into `lambda.json`, so a deployment with many large zips (e.g. 26 functions × ~30 MB) produced a ~1 GB state file that OOM'd on warm boot while decoding. Code bytes are now written as content-addressed blobs alongside the state and loaded lazily. Contributed by @mattwang44.
- **Lambda — CloudFormation/CDK-provisioned layers now carry their content** — layers created via CloudFormation stored no `_zip_data`, so `_resolve_layer_zip` returned `None` at worker spawn and functions could not import their layer packages even though `ListLayers` showed them. The provisioner now stores the layer bytes.
- **Lambda — CloudFormation-created DynamoDB-stream ESMs anchor `LATEST` at create time** — matching the `CreateEventSourceMapping` API path, so a `LATEST` mapping skips records that already existed when the stack was deployed instead of replaying them; no-op for SQS/Kinesis sources.
- **ECS — `RunTask` secrets now resolve SSM Parameter Store references** — `containerDefinitions[].secrets` `valueFrom` entries pointing at SSM parameters were previously left unresolved; they are now fetched in-process and injected into the container environment alongside Secrets Manager references.

---

## [1.3.64] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **Step Functions — mocked `Throw` responses now route to `Catch`** — a `SFN_MOCK_CONFIG` `Throw` was raised above the state's Retry/Catch handling, so the execution always failed instead of routing to a matching `Catch` handler. The mocked error now flows through the same Retry/Catch machinery as a real task failure. Reported by @amissemer.
- **Glue — `GetUserDefinedFunctions` treats `Pattern` as a regular expression** — the pattern was matched as a glob, so regex patterns (such as the Trino Glue connector's `trino__<name>__.*`) never matched; an invalid pattern now returns `InvalidInputException`. Contributed by @yonatoasis.
- **S3 — `WebsiteRedirectLocation` is now preserved** — `x-amz-website-redirect-location` set on `PutObject` is now stored and returned by `GetObject` / `HeadObject`. Contributed by @murlock.
- **IAM — instance-profile tagging actions implemented** — `TagInstanceProfile`, `UntagInstanceProfile`, and `ListInstanceProfileTags` previously failed with `InvalidAction: Unknown IAM action`. They are now handled, tags are stored on the instance-profile object (including tags supplied at `CreateInstanceProfile` time), and they read back from `GetInstanceProfile` / `ListInstanceProfiles` (via the `Tags` member) and `ListInstanceProfileTags`. This read-back lets Terraform's `aws_iam_instance_profile` settle to "No changes" on re-apply instead of detecting tag drift. Contributed by @c-julin.
- **EventBridge — input transformer reserved variables** — substitute `<aws.events.event.json>`, `<aws.events.event>`, `<aws.events.rule-name>`, `<aws.events.rule-arn>`, and `<aws.events.event.ingestion-time>` so CDK-style templates that embed the source event deliver valid JSON. Contributed by @AbdoNile.
- **CloudFormation — `GetTemplateSummary` now returns `Capabilities` and `CapabilitiesReason`** — the handler already accepted `TemplateBody` and returned `Parameters` / `ResourceTypes` correctly, but omitted the `Capabilities` and `CapabilitiesReason` fields. These are now computed from the template: `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` for IAM resources with explicit name properties (`RoleName`, `UserName`, etc.), `CAPABILITY_IAM` for unnamed IAM resources, and `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND` for templates with a `Transform`. `CapabilitiesReason` uses the format confirmed against the AWS API: `"The following resource(s) require capabilities: [<type>]"`. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **Lambda - CreateEventSourceMapping persists FilterCriteria** — CreateEventSourceMapping was silently dropping the FilterCriteria parameter, so any filter specified at creation time was never applied. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **ECS — `RunTask` now applies `containerOverrides.command` to the launched Docker container** — Overridden commands (including an explicit empty command) were ignored at runtime because the Docker `containers.run(...)` call still used the task-definition command.  The effective container definition now carries the matched override command into Docker, while non-overridden containers keep their defaults. Contributed by @noynoy83.
- **ECS — `RunTask` now injects `containerDefinitions[].secrets` from Secrets Manager** — secret `valueFrom` references (including the `:json-key:` form that selects one field from a JSON secret) were silently dropped, so containers started without those environment variables. They are now resolved in-process and merged into the container environment before container overrides are applied; SSM Parameter Store references are not yet resolved. Reported by @kamegoro. Contributed by @kurok.
- **S3 — `DeletePublicAccessBlock` now actually clears the configuration** — after delete, `GetPublicAccessBlock` returned a default all-blocked configuration with HTTP 200 instead of `NoSuchPublicAccessBlockConfiguration` (404), so the delete was not observable and Terraform's `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` delete waiter timed out (`found resource`), blocking `terraform destroy`. `GetPublicAccessBlock` now returns 404 when no configuration is set (never configured, or deleted). Reported by @kamegoro. Contributed by @kurok.
- **Lambda - CloudFormation-created ESMs now poll DynamoDB Streams** — Before, these streams were not getting polled. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **CloudWatch Logs — subscription filters now deliver matching log events to the destination Lambda** — a `SubscriptionFilter` (created via CloudFormation or `PutSubscriptionFilter`) was provisioned but never forwarded log events, so the processor Lambda was never invoked. Matching events from `PutLogEvents` and from Lambda's own log emission are now delivered to Lambda destinations in AWS's `awslogs` gzip+base64 `DATA_MESSAGE` envelope, with a self-loop guard so a filter on a function's own log group can't recurse. Reported by @ankitaabad.

---

## [1.3.63] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- **Step Functions — `Assign` is now applied in the mock execution path for JSONata Task states** — when `SFN_MOCK_CONFIG` was active, `_apply_state_assign` was never called on the mock return branch, so any `Assign` block in a JSONata Task state was silently skipped; downstream states referencing the assigned variables failed with `States.QueryEvaluationError: Undefined variable`. The mock branch now mirrors the real execution path by calling `_apply_state_assign` after `_apply_jsonata_output`. Contributed by @amissemer.
- **Step Functions — Pass state `Parameters` now resolve context object paths** — `$$.*` references resolved to `null` in Pass states because `_execute_pass` applied `Parameters` without forwarding the execution context. It now forwards the context correctly when evaluating `Parameters`, fixing context object resolution for Pass states. Contributed by @noynoy83.
- **CloudFormation — `DescribeStackResources` now honors the `LogicalResourceId` filter** — The handler now reads the optional `LogicalResourceId` parameter and, when present, returns only the matching resource or a `ValidationError` if it does not exist in the stack. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **Lambda — local executor now exposes dependency layers' `site-packages`** — the in-process Python worker added `<layer>/python` to `sys.path` but not `<layer>/python/lib/python<ver>/site-packages`, so `pip install -t` dependency layers failed to import (the docker executor, which uses the AWS runtime image, was unaffected). Reported by @omargr299.
- **Lambda — `LoggingConfig.LogGroup` is honored when emitting CloudWatch logs** — handler output was always written to the default `/aws/lambda/<name>` group instead of the configured or shared log group. Reported by @ankitaabad.
- **CloudFormation — `AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter` resource type supported** — templates using it no longer fail with `Unsupported resource type`; the filter provisions against the named log group and is removed on stack delete. Reported by @ankitaabad.
- **CloudFormation — change sets detect parameter-driven property changes** — `aws cloudformation deploy` silently no-oped when a property such as a Lambda `Code` S3 key was driven by a stack parameter, because the change-set diff compared unresolved templates. It now resolves parameters and intrinsics before diffing, matching `update-stack`. Reported by @ankitaabad.

---

## [1.3.62] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Glue — Iceberg REST Catalog (Glue-backed)** — read-path subset of the Apache Iceberg REST OpenAPI at `/iceberg`, mirroring AWS Glue's `glue.<region>.amazonaws.com/iceberg` endpoint (prefix shape `catalogs/{catalog}`), served on the `glue` credential scope — distinct from the S3 Tables Iceberg surface, exactly as on real AWS. `GET /v1/config`, `ListNamespaces`, `GetNamespace`, `ListTables`, `LoadTable`, `HEAD` `TableExists`; writes return 501. A Glue table participates when its `Parameters["metadata_location"]` points at an Iceberg `metadata.json` on MiniStack S3 (written by an external engine such as Trino/Spark; passed through verbatim). Lets DuckDB's `iceberg` extension `ATTACH` against MiniStack (requires `USE_SSL=1`). Contributed by @yonatoasis.
- **Glue — `ColumnStatistics` API family (Table + Partition)** — `UpdateColumnStatisticsForTable` / `GetColumnStatisticsForTable` / `DeleteColumnStatisticsForTable` and the `*ForPartition` equivalents, with AWS's `{ColumnStatisticsList, Errors}` / `{Errors}` response shapes and per-column `EntityNotFoundException` error entries. Stats are account-scoped, persisted, and cleared when the owning table/partition is deleted. Contributed by @yonatoasis.

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation — `DescribeStackEvents` returns the initial `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` event for change-set-created stacks** — `CreateChangeSet` with `--change-set-type CREATE` left the placeholder stack in `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` but seeded an empty event list, so `DescribeStackEvents` returned `[]` and tools reading `StackEvents[0]` (notably `sam deploy`) crashed with `IndexError`. The placeholder stack now emits the `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` event for the `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource on creation. Contributed by @maximoosemine.
- **Step Functions — `ecs:runTask` / `ecs:runTask.sync` no longer drop `ContainerOverrides`** — the Pascal→camelCase conversion at the SFN→ECS hand-off only covered top-level `Parameters` keys, so nested `Overrides.ContainerOverrides` (including resolved `"Value.$"` entries) and `NetworkConfiguration` stayed PascalCase and were silently ignored — the container ran with task-definition environment only while the `.sync` state still succeeded. The conversion is now recursive. Contributed by @lucasmfraser.
- **Lambda — layers are reachable in the docker executor, and zip permissions are preserved** — the docker RIE executor extracted each layer to `/opt/layer_N`, which is not on the runtime's search path, so `import` from a layer failed; layer contents now merge into `/opt` (so `/opt/python`, `/opt/lib`, `/opt/bin` resolve), exactly as on real AWS. Layer and function zip extraction now also restores unix mode bits, so `/opt/bin` tools and bundled binaries keep their `+x`. Reported by @omargr299.
- **`awslocal` works in TLS mode without `--no-verify-ssl`** — the wrapper now resolves MiniStack's TLS certificate (the auto-generated `${TMPDIR}/ministack-tls/server.crt`, or a `MINISTACK_SSL_CERT` / `MINISTACK_CA_BUNDLE` override) and exports `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` only when it points at a real file, so the AWS CLI verifies the cert instead of failing — plain-HTTP usage is untouched. Reported by @ChronosMasterOfAllTime.
- **Lambda — restored SQS event source mappings resume polling after a warm restart** — the ESM poller is started from `lambda_svc`'s import-time restore, but the module was imported lazily only on a Lambda request, so after a persisted restart a pure-SQS workload (just sending to a mapped queue) never started the poller and the restored mapping sat `Enabled` but unpolled while messages piled up. `lambda_svc` is now eager-imported at boot when persisted ESMs exist, so polling resumes exactly like a fresh `CreateEventSourceMapping`. Reported by @ChronosMasterOfAllTime.

---

## [1.3.61] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **AmazonMQ (`mq`)** — new service emulator for AWS MQ, covering both RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ engines. Broker control plane: `CreateBroker`, `ListBrokers`, `DescribeBroker`, `UpdateBroker`, `DeleteBroker`, `RebootBroker`, plus `DescribeBrokerEngineTypes` and `DescribeBrokerInstanceOptions` (engine / version / instance / storage matrix sourced from real `aws mq describe-broker-instance-options` output). ActiveMQ user management (`CreateUser`, `DescribeUser`, `UpdateUser`, `DeleteUser`, `ListUsers`) and broker tagging (`CreateTags`, `ListTags`, `DeleteTags`). Brokers come up `RUNNING` immediately (metadata only, no container); `CreateBroker` validates engine type, version, deployment mode, host instance type, and storage type against the supported matrix. State is account-scoped and persisted. Contributed by @lucas-giaco.
- **IAM — `GetAccountSummary`, `GetAccountPasswordPolicy`, `UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy`, `DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy`, `ListAccountAliases`, `CreateAccountAlias`, `DeleteAccountAlias`** — account-level posture reads. `GetAccountSummary` returns computed counts (`Users`, `Groups`, `Roles`, `Policies`, `MFADevices`, `MFADevicesInUse`, `AccountMFAEnabled`) plus static quotas. `GetAccountPasswordPolicy` returns `NoSuchEntity` (404) before any policy is set, matching real AWS. Account aliases stored per-account (replace-on-create semantics). Contributed by @lahmish.
- **IAM — `GenerateCredentialReport`, `GetCredentialReport`** — generates and returns the account credential report as a CSV (exact AWS column header). One row per user including `password_enabled` (from login profiles), `mfa_active` (from MFA device assignments), and `access_key_1/2_active` (from access-key status). Root account synthetic row included. `GetCredentialReport` returns `ReportNotPresent` (410) when no report has been generated. `Content` is base64-encoded per the AWS blob encoding contract. Contributed by @lahmish.

### Fixed
- **S3 — event notifications now fire for non-default accounts** — `PutObject` / object-removed notifications are delivered from a background thread that did not inherit the request's account context, so the worker ran under the default account (`000000000000`): the account-scoped bucket-notification config resolved empty and the event was silently dropped for any non-default account, while SQS / SNS / Lambda / EventBridge targets resolved under the wrong account. The thread now copies the request context (account + region); the `s3:TestEvent` path had the same gap and is fixed too. Reported by @rsking.

---

## [1.3.60] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **IAM — `CreateLoginProfile`, `GetLoginProfile`, `UpdateLoginProfile`, `DeleteLoginProfile`** — models whether an IAM user has a console password (the signal that a user is a human). `CreateLoginProfile` stores `UserName`, `CreateDate`, and `PasswordResetRequired` without persisting the password value (seed-side). `GetLoginProfile` returns `NoSuchEntity` (404) when no profile exists. `UpdateLoginProfile` updates `PasswordResetRequired`. `DeleteLoginProfile` removes the profile. All four operations match the real AWS request/response shapes exactly so identity-discovery agents can distinguish humans from service accounts using `get-login-profile`. Contributed by @lahmish.
- **IAM — `CreateVirtualMFADevice`, `EnableMFADevice`, `DeactivateMFADevice`, `ResyncMFADevice`, `ListMFADevices`, `ListVirtualMFADevices`, `DeleteVirtualMFADevice`** — full virtual MFA device lifecycle. `CreateVirtualMFADevice` returns `SerialNumber` (ARN form `arn:aws:iam::<acct>:mfa/<name>`) plus `Base32StringSeed` and `QRCodePNG` blobs (base64-encoded). `EnableMFADevice` accepts any TOTP codes (seed-side lenience). `ListVirtualMFADevices` supports `AssignmentStatus` filter (`Assigned` / `Unassigned` / `Any`; default `Any`). `DeleteVirtualMFADevice` returns `DeleteConflict` (409) for assigned devices. Contributed by @lahmish.
- **IAM — `GetAccountAuthorizationDetails`** — the one-shot identity graph. Returns `UserDetailList` (inline policies, attached managed policies, group memberships, tags), `GroupDetailList`, `RoleDetailList` (inline policies, attached managed policies, instance profiles, tags, assume-role document url-encoded), and `Policies` (customer-managed, with url-encoded version documents). `Filter.member.N` honored: `User`, `Group`, `Role`, `LocalManagedPolicy`. `IsTruncated=false`; pagination optional. Contributed by @lahmish.
- **IAM — `CreateSAMLProvider`, `GetSAMLProvider`, `ListSAMLProviders`, `UpdateSAMLProvider`, `DeleteSAMLProvider`, `ListOpenIDConnectProviders`** — SAML IdP CRUD plus OIDC provider enumeration. Accepts any non-empty `SAMLMetadataDocument` (real AWS requires valid XML ≥1000 chars; that validation is seed-side). `GetSAMLProvider` returns `SAMLMetadataDocument`, `CreateDate`, `ValidUntil`, and `Tags`. `ListOpenIDConnectProviders` returns `{Arn}` entries (create/get/delete existed previously). Enables agents to enumerate federated IdPs cross-referenced with role trust policies. Contributed by @lahmish.
- **IAM — `GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails`, `GetServiceLastAccessedDetails`** — Access Advisor generate→get job handshake. Returns a UUID `JobId`. `GetServiceLastAccessedDetails` returns `JobStatus=COMPLETED` and an empty `ServicesLastAccessed` list (no CloudTrail data). Contributed by @lahmish.

### Fixed
- **Cognito — `RespondToAuthChallenge` / `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` merge CUSTOM_AUTH verify result into the pending challenge round** — the verify result was appended as a second, metadata-less `session` entry, splitting one round across two records. AWS records **one** `ChallengeResult` per round, carrying both `challengeMetadata` (from `CreateAuthChallenge`) and `challengeResult` (from `VerifyAuthChallengeResponse`) — multi-round flows that read both fields from the same element (e.g. magic-link → SMS-OTP) never advanced. The pending round is now updated in place. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil.
- **SQS — out-of-range numeric attributes rejected with `InvalidAttributeValue`** — `CreateQueue` and `SetQueueAttributes` accepted any value and stored it verbatim, so `VisibilityTimeout=99999` (and every other numeric attribute) was silently kept. Now `VisibilityTimeout` (0..43200), `MaximumMessageSize` (1024..262144), `MessageRetentionPeriod` (60..1209600), `DelaySeconds` (0..900), `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` (0..20), and `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` (60..86400) are validated against the AWS ranges and rejected with `InvalidAttributeValue` (400) when outside the documented bounds or non-numeric. Reported by @dcabib.
- **EventBridge — `anything-but` honors nested `prefix` / `suffix` / `wildcard` content filters** — `{"anything-but": {"prefix": "TEST-"}}` (and `suffix` / `wildcard` variants) was silently ignored at dispatch and every event matched regardless of the field value, because the handler only recognized literal and list-of-literal forms. The nested-matcher form per AWS docs is now negated correctly: an event whose field matches the nested filter is excluded. Reported by @aldirrix.
- **ElastiCache — Redis container respawned after restart** — with `PERSIST_STATE=1`, restored cluster metadata reported `CacheClusterStatus=available` but the persisted Docker container id no longer existed, so the endpoint was unreachable even though `DescribeCacheClusters` looked healthy. Restored clusters and replication groups are now marked pending respawn at `restore_state` time and lazily spawned (under a lock to prevent concurrent first-requests from double-spawning) on the first dispatcher call — endpoint metadata is rewritten to the freshly-spawned container before any caller can read it. Failures are logged once and cleared from the pending set (no retry storm). Reported by @ItsSmiffy.

## [1.3.59] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **CloudFormation — AWS::AppConfig::Environment, ConfigurationProfile, HostedConfigurationVersion, DeploymentStrategy, Deployment** — five new provisioners closing the AppConfig CFN surface (Application was added in v1.3.55). Property names, defaults, Ref returns, and Fn::GetAtt attribute names (`EnvironmentId`; `ConfigurationProfileId` + `KmsKeyArn`; `VersionNumber`; `Id`; `DeploymentNumber` + `State`) match the AWS CFN reference verbatim. `HostedConfigurationVersion` enforces the optional `LatestVersionNumber` locking token against the current latest version. `Deployment` tags are stored against the AWS-shape ARN (`arn:aws:appconfig:{region}:{account}:application/{app}/environment/{env}/deployment/{num}`). Reported by @zdenekmartinec.
- **AppSync — full AWS-standard `AppSyncResolverEvent` for AWS_LAMBDA data sources** — `arguments`, `source`, `request.headers`, `prev`, `stash`, `info.{fieldName, parentTypeName, variables}` built per the AppSync Lambda-resolver tutorial. For `AWS_LAMBDA` auth mode, the authorizer Lambda is invoked first and its `resolverContext` is threaded into `identity`. The authorizer event matches the verbatim AWS shape: `authorizationToken`, `requestHeaders`, and `requestContext` with `apiId` / `accountId` / `requestId` / `queryString` / `operationName` / `variables`. Unhandled resolver exceptions surface as a GraphQL `errors` entry instead of leaking the RIE error payload as `data`. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil.
- **Glue — `BatchUpdatePartition`** — closes the last partition action gap; matches AWS's per-entry shape (`Entries[*].{PartitionValueList, PartitionInput}` in, `Errors[*].{PartitionValueList, ErrorDetail{ErrorCode, ErrorMessage}}` out). Updates the matched partition in place preserving `CreationTime` and refreshing `LastAccessTime`; per-entry `EntityNotFoundException` on missing partition; request-level `EntityNotFoundException` on unknown table. Contributed by @yonatoasis.

### Fixed
- **Lambda — layers mount inside the docker executor (DinD)** — `_spawn_lambda_container` extracted layers via `container.put_archive(...)`, but the Docker API requires the destination path to already exist in the container; the base Lambda RIE image has `/opt` but no `/opt/layer_N` subdir, so the call returned 404 (`Could not find the file /opt/layer_0 in container ...`). The cp now extracts into the existing `/opt` with `arcname=f"layer_{idx}"`, materialising `/opt/layer_N/...` from the tar. Also reaps the docker warm-container pool on `UpdateFunctionConfiguration` (worker-affecting field change) and `DeleteFunction`, mirroring the in-process worker invalidation from v1.3.58 — without this, the docker pool (keyed on `acct:func:zip:CodeSha256`) reuses pre-attach containers and the layer is never mounted on the reused container. Reported by @omargr299.
- **API Gateway v2 — JWT authorizer resolves JWKS via OIDC discovery for non-Cognito issuers** — `_resolve_jwks_url` hardcoded `{issuer}/.well-known/jwks.json`, which 404s for issuers whose keys live elsewhere (Salesforce `/id/keys`, Okta `/oauth2/v1/keys`). The resolver now fetches `{issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration`, reads the published `jwks_uri`, and caches per-issuer for 2h; the Cognito short-circuit is preserved, and the conventional `/.well-known/jwks.json` path remains the fallback when discovery is unavailable. Contributed by @Pratham2703005.
- **S3 — `PutObject` checksums (SHA256 / SHA1 / CRC32) are stored and surfaced on `GetObject` / `HeadObject`** — `PutObject` previously dropped every `x-amz-checksum-*` header on the floor and `Get` / `HeadObject(ChecksumMode='ENABLED')` returned no `ChecksumSHA256` (or sibling), so SDK-side integrity checks always failed. Now the object record carries an AWS-shape `checksums` dict; client-supplied values are accepted; `x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm: SHA256 | SHA1 | CRC32` triggers server-side compute; a mismatch between the supplied value and the server-computed one is rejected with `BadDigest`. `CopyObject` propagates the source's checksum (or accepts/computes a new algorithm against the copied body). Versioned reads (`GetObject?versionId=X`) return the per-version checksum. `Get` / `HeadObject` emit checksum headers only when the request carries `x-amz-checksum-mode: ENABLED`, and never on `206 Partial Content` (a whole-object checksum can't validate a sliced response). Checksums persist across restart via the on-disk meta sidecar. CRC32C / CRC64NVME require optional native libs not in stdlib; rather than silently accept unverifiable client-supplied values for those, ministack rejects the put with a clear `InvalidRequest` pointing to the supported algorithms. Reported by @Guigoz.
- **S3 — on-disk bucket directory is account-scoped** — `CreateBucket` persisted its directory at `DATA_DIR/<bucket>` while every object write goes to the account-scoped `DATA_DIR/<account>/<bucket>/<key>` (via `_object_disk_path`). The unscoped `makedirs` left a spurious empty folder at the data-dir root that no code path ever used; `DeleteBucket` left it behind even after the bucket record was gone. `_create_bucket` / `_delete_bucket` now scope the directory to the current account, matching the object-write layout end-to-end. Reported by @rsking.
- **Glue — `StartJobRun` script resolution + crawler completion under non-default accounts** — `_resolve_script` built an unscoped on-disk path while S3 persists objects at `DATA_DIR/<account>/<bucket>/<key>`, so file-backed Glue scripts never resolved; and `_finish_crawl` runs on a `threading.Timer` which doesn't copy contextvars, so for any non-default account the account-scoped `_crawlers` guard missed and the crawler hung in `RUNNING` forever. The script path now includes `get_account_id()` to match the canonical writer; the job-run thread and crawler timer are wrapped with `contextvars.copy_context().run(...)` (the same idiom as `stepfunctions.py` / `rds.py`) so the request's account is carried into background work. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil.

## [1.3.58] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **EKS — default `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and `topology.kubernetes.io/region` labels on k3s nodes** — every cluster's k3s container now receives `--node-label topology.kubernetes.io/zone={region}a` and `--node-label topology.kubernetes.io/region={region}`, matching the labels real EKS nodes carry via the AWS cloud-controller-manager. Unblocks topology-aware controllers (Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, scheduler `topologySpreadConstraints`) without manual `kubectl label node` workarounds. Region resolves through `get_region()`. Per-node-group label overrides belong on `CreateNodegroup.labels` — the AWS-shape-correct surface. Contributed by @b-rajesh.
- **KMS — Ed25519 (`ECC_NIST_EDWARDS25519`) sign/verify** — `CreateKey` accepts `ECC_NIST_EDWARDS25519`, returns `SigningAlgorithms=["ED25519_SHA_512","ED25519_PH_SHA_512"]` (both algorithms per the AWS Developer Guide "Supported signing algorithms for ECC key specs" table). `Sign`/`Verify` for `ED25519_SHA_512` enforces `MessageType=RAW` per the AWS Sign API contract ("ED25519_SHA_512 signing algorithm requires MessageType:RAW… cannot be used interchangeably"); `ED25519_PH_SHA_512` (Ed25519ph / HashEdDSA, RFC 8032 §5.1) returns `UnsupportedOperationException` rather than route through pure Ed25519 — those signatures would be incompatible with real AWS KMS. Contributed by @KABBOUCHI.
- **ELBv2 — `SetSubnets`, `SetIpAddressType`, `SetSecurityGroups`** — three load-balancer mutation actions now implemented per botocore output shapes: `SetSubnets` returns `AvailabilityZones` + `IpAddressType`, `SetIpAddressType` returns `IpAddressType`, `SetSecurityGroups` returns `SecurityGroupIds` (note: not `SecurityGroups`).
- **Glue — `CreateUserDefinedFunction` / `UpdateUserDefinedFunction` / `DeleteUserDefinedFunction` / `GetUserDefinedFunction` / `GetUserDefinedFunctions`** — full UDF lifecycle at `AWSGlue.<verb>`. Records carry `FunctionName`, `DatabaseName`, `ClassName`, `OwnerName`, `OwnerType`, `CreateTime`, `ResourceUris`, `CatalogId` per the AWS `UserDefinedFunction` output shape. `GetUserDefinedFunctions` honors the AWS-required `Pattern` glob.
- **IAM — seeded AWS-managed policies for EKS** — `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy`, `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`, `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy`, `AmazonEKSServicePolicy` now resolve to the real AWS policy documents (verbatim from the AWS Managed Policy Reference), not the wildcard `Allow *` fallback. `GetPolicyVersion` returns the real action lists so policy simulators / Terraform diffs match real AWS.

### Fixed
- **EC2 — `Attachment.AttachTime` on ENI describe** — `AttachNetworkInterface` now records the attach timestamp on the ENI's Attachment record; `DescribeNetworkInterfaces` surfaces it as `<attachTime>` in the wire XML, matching the AWS `NetworkInterfaceAttachment` shape. Required by tools that audit attachment age (Cloud Custodian, Config rules).
- **Glue — `CreateDatabase` honors top-level `Tags`** — `CreateDatabase` previously dropped `Tags` on the floor; tags are now stored against the database ARN (`arn:aws:glue:{region}:{account}:database/{name}`) and retrievable via `GetTags`. `DeleteDatabase` cleans them up.
- **Glue — `UpdateTable` optimistic concurrency via `VersionId`** — table records now carry a monotonically-increasing `VersionId` (string, per the AWS `Table` output shape). `UpdateTable` with a stale `VersionId` returns `ConcurrentModificationException`; matching version bumps and applies. Calls without `VersionId` keep the old last-write-wins behaviour for back-compat.
- **ECS — `DeleteService` marks INACTIVE instead of removing the record** — matches the AWS contract: "Services in the `DRAINING` or `INACTIVE` status can still be viewed with the `DescribeServices` API operation." Tasks are stopped synchronously, the service stays describable with `status=INACTIVE`, and tags remain attached. Re-creating a service with the same name is allowed once the prior incarnation is `INACTIVE` (matches the AWS-documented conflict-only-on-ACTIVE/DRAINING rule).
- **Lambda — layer `CodeSize` and post-attachment invocation** — `CreateFunction(Layers=[...])` and `UpdateFunctionConfiguration(Layers=[...])` now surface each layer's real `CodeSize` on `GetFunctionConfiguration.Layers[*].CodeSize` (looked up from the published layer version) instead of a hardcoded `0`. `UpdateFunctionConfiguration` also recycles the `$LATEST` warm worker when worker-affecting fields change (`Layers`, `Runtime`, `Handler`, `Environment`, `MemorySize`, `Architectures`, `VpcConfig`, `FileSystemConfigs`) — without this, a layer attached after the first invoke was never extracted into `/opt/layer_N` for the running worker, and `import` from the layer failed at handler entry. Reported by @omargr299.
- **Cognito — `CUSTOM_AUTH` trigger Lambdas no longer deadlock the event loop** — `_dispatch_idp` and `_dispatch_identity` are now `async` and run their sync handlers via `asyncio.to_thread`. Previously, a Cognito op that invoked a trigger Lambda (Define / Create / Verify auth challenge, pre-token, etc.) blocked the ASGI event loop while waiting for the Lambda HTTP callback that the same loop needed to serve — every CUSTOM_AUTH flow hung at the first trigger. Reported by @aahoughton.

## [1.3.57] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **EC2 Fleet — `CreateFleet` + `DescribeFleets`** — Tier-1 capacity allocation: parses `TargetCapacitySpecification` (incl. `DefaultTargetCapacityType` for spot vs on-demand), `LaunchTemplateConfigs[*]` with `Overrides[*]`, and `TagSpecifications`. `Type=instant` launches synchronously and returns the populated `Instances` / `Errors` blocks; `Type=maintain` / `request` return `FleetId` alone with `ActivityStatus=pending_fulfillment` and `FulfilledCapacity=0` per the AWS contract. Total capacity is round-robin distributed across every `(config, override)` slot, with one `Instances[*]` item per non-empty slot carrying its own `LaunchTemplateAndOverrides`. `DescribeFleets` on an unknown `FleetId` returns `InvalidFleetId.NotFound` (was silently empty). Unblocks Karpenter / Cluster Autoscaler local validation. Reported by @b-rajesh. Contributed by @b-rajesh.
- **EKS — OIDC Identity Provider Config** — `AssociateIdentityProviderConfig`, `DescribeIdentityProviderConfig`, `DisassociateIdentityProviderConfig` at `/clusters/{name}/identity-provider-configs/{verb}`. Required-field validation (`oidc.identityProviderConfigName`, `issuerUrl`, `clientId`); duplicate or any-second OIDC config rejected with `ResourceInUseException` (real AWS allows one OIDC IdP per cluster); IdP ARN `arn:aws:eks:{region}:{account}:identityproviderconfig/{cluster}/oidc/{name}/{uuid}` returned at associate time and stable across describes so Terraform / CDK / Pulumi don't see drift; tags wired through `ListTagsForResource(resourceArn=idp_arn)`. Issuer URL + client ID + optional username/groups claims are forwarded to the k3s API server via `--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-*` flags on restart. Cluster status stays `ACTIVE` throughout (the work is carried in the returned `update` record, not on the cluster). Contributed by @b-rajesh.
- **SQS — `/_ministack/sqs/messages` admin endpoint** — `GET` returns every queue's messages grouped by account (`MessageId`, `Body`, `MD5OfBody`, `SentTimestamp`, `VisibleAt`, `IsVisible`, `ReceiveCount`, `FirstReceiveTimestamp`, `MessageAttributes`, `Attributes`, `MessageGroupId`, `MessageDeduplicationId`, `SequenceNumber`). Optional `?account=<12-digit>` and `?QueueUrl=<url>` filters. Pure introspection — does not mutate `visible_at` / `receive_count` / any field a concurrent `ReceiveMessage` touches. Mirrors the existing `/_ministack/ses/messages` pattern. Reported by @mbamber.
- **`MINISTACK_RDS_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` env var** — set `1` when ministack itself runs in Docker but RDS clients reach the engine from outside that Docker network (remote ministack host, CI runners, host-side clients). `DescribeDBInstances` then returns `{MINISTACK_HOST, host_port}` — the published host port — instead of the container-internal address that's invisible from outside the network. Off by default, so existing deployments (native, or in-Docker with apps on the same network) keep their current behavior byte-for-byte.

### Fixed
- **AppConfigData — `StartConfigurationSession` accepts identifier by ID *or* name** — `ApplicationIdentifier`, `EnvironmentIdentifier`, and `ConfigurationProfileIdentifier` are documented in `service-2.json` as accepting either form; ministack previously treated them as IDs only, so passing names (a perfectly valid AWS pattern) produced a session token that referred to a non-resolvable triple. Each identifier is now resolved through ID-first / name-fallback lookups; unresolved → `ResourceNotFoundException` 404. Contributed by @LiamMacP.
- **DynamoDB — `ExportTableToPointInTime` returns `IN_PROGRESS` at submit, `COMPLETED` only after the grace window** — the handler previously set `IN_PROGRESS` then overwrote it to `COMPLETED` on the very next `DescribeExport` call, so callers never observed an in-progress export. Submit now returns `IN_PROGRESS` and the flip happens in `_describe_export` only after `MINISTACK_DDB_EXPORT_COMPLETE_AFTER_SEC` (default 1s) has elapsed — matching real AWS, which always reports `IN_PROGRESS` at submit time. Reported by @hicksy. Contributed by @HarrisonTCodes.
- **DynamoDB — `ImportTable` returns `IN_PROGRESS` at submit, `COMPLETED` only after the grace window** — same fix shape: `ImportTable` was building the response with `ImportStatus=COMPLETED` synchronously, never giving callers a chance to observe the in-progress state real AWS guarantees. Now starts `IN_PROGRESS` with no `EndTime`; `DescribeImport` flips to `COMPLETED` and stamps `EndTime` after `MINISTACK_DDB_IMPORT_COMPLETE_AFTER_SEC` (default 1s). Reported by @hicksy.
- **DynamoDB PartiQL — `UPDATE` / `DELETE` with a false non-key predicate now returns `ConditionalCheckFailedException`** — `UPDATE "t" SET n=9 WHERE pk='x' AND name='beta'` against an item with `name='alpha'` previously silently no-op'd (PartiQL handlers iterated all rows and matched none). AWS treats the non-key clauses as a conditional check on the PK-targeted item: if the targeted item doesn't exist or any non-PK predicate fails, the request must surface `ConditionalCheckFailedException` and leave the item unchanged. Also: `UPDATE` / `DELETE` without an `=` clause on every primary-key attribute now returns `ValidationException` up front instead of falling through to the table scan. Reported by @hicksy.
- **EKS — IdP changes no longer mutate cluster status** — `AssociateIdentityProviderConfig` / `DisassociateIdentityProviderConfig` previously flipped `cluster.status` to `UPDATING` during the k3s restart, then back to `ACTIVE`. Real AWS keeps the cluster `ACTIVE` throughout — the work is carried in the returned `Update` record, not on the cluster shape. Only `cfg.status` is mutated now. The destructive k3s restart that wipes in-cluster workloads on associate/disassociate (a local-emulator limitation — k3s can't hot-swap kube-apiserver flags) is logged as a warning so the side effect is surfaced.
- **EC2 `CreateFleet` — shape parity restored** — `Instances` and `Errors` are now emitted only when `Type=instant` (the AWS-documented constraint); for `maintain` / `request` the response is `<fleetId>` alone, instances launch asynchronously, `FulfilledCapacity=0`, `ActivityStatus=pending_fulfillment`. `DefaultTargetCapacityType` (not `Type`) drives `Lifecycle` / `SpotTargetCapacity` / `OnDemandTargetCapacity` — the previous code compared `fleet_type == "spot"`, which is dead since the `FleetType` enum is `{request, maintain, instant}` and never contains `"spot"`. Multi-config × multi-override distribution: every `LaunchTemplateConfigs[*].Overrides[*]` slot now receives its share of `TotalTargetCapacity` (round-robin) and renders its own `Instances[*]` item with the correct `LaunchTemplateAndOverrides`. Tag-spec parser also accepts the AWS plural `TagSpecifications[*].Tags[*]` shape alongside the previous singular.
- **EC2 `DescribeFleets` with an unknown `FleetId` → `InvalidFleetId.NotFound`** — previously dropped silently from the fleet set, so callers had no signal that a typo'd ID hadn't matched anything. Real EC2 returns the error envelope (HTTP 400); known IDs are preserved in the requested order alongside.

### Changed
- **`MINISTACK_HOST` honored consistently across services** — `ecs._discover_poll_endpoint`, `elasticache._spawn_redis_container`, `opensearch._spawn_dataplane`, `lambda_svc._execute_function_local` (subprocess `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`) and several response-URL builders previously had `"localhost"` hardcoded and ignored `MINISTACK_HOST`. They now resolve through a module-level `_MINISTACK_HOST = os.environ.get("MINISTACK_HOST", "localhost")`, so a ministack running on a different host can be reached over the network with the standard describe-... commands (set `MINISTACK_HOST=<remote-ip>` at boot). Default behavior unchanged for existing localhost deployments. Contributed by @neriyaco.

---

## [1.3.56] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Cognito User Pools — `CUSTOM_AUTH` flow with DefineAuthChallenge / CreateAuthChallenge / VerifyAuthChallengeResponse triggers** — `InitiateAuth` / `AdminInitiateAuth` / `RespondToAuthChallenge` / `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` now run the full custom-auth state machine through the configured Lambdas. `DefineAuthChallenge` decides next-step / `issueTokens` / `failAuthentication`; `CreateAuthChallenge` builds public + private challenge parameters carried through the opaque session token; `VerifyAuthChallengeResponse` evaluates the answer. Session TTL honors the client's `AuthSessionValidity` (minutes), capped at 3 answered rounds per AWS. Unblocks passwordless / magic-link / SMS-OTP flows that previously failed with `Unsupported AuthFlow: CUSTOM_AUTH`. Reported by @aahoughton. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil.
- **EKS Access Entries (modern IAM bindings — replace aws-auth ConfigMap)** — 8 new ops at `/clusters/{name}/access-entries[/{principalArn}[/access-policies[/{policyArn}]]]`: `CreateAccessEntry`, `DescribeAccessEntry`, `ListAccessEntries`, `UpdateAccessEntry`, `DeleteAccessEntry`, `AssociateAccessPolicy`, `DisassociateAccessPolicy`, `ListAssociatedAccessPolicies`. `accessScope` validated against `{cluster, namespace}` with `namespaces` required when scope is namespace-bound; deleting an access entry cascades its associated policies. Unblocks Crossplane `accessentry.eks.aws.upbound.io`, Terraform `aws_eks_access_entry` + `aws_eks_access_policy_association`, and any tool using the post-`1.29` EKS IAM binding API. Reported by @b-rajesh.

### Fixed
- **Lambda — `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` injected for `TracingConfig.Mode=Active`** — the runtime env var the AWS X-Ray SDK reads on every segment was never being set, so `aws-xray-sdk-python` raised `Missing AWS Lambda trace data for X-Ray` on any active-tracing function. Now synthesized per invocation (`Root=1-<8hex>-<24hex>;Parent=<16hex>;Sampled=1`) and threaded into the warm worker pool (Python + Node bootstraps pop the event field into `os.environ` / `process.env`), the provided-runtime executor (per-spawn `proc_env`), and the local subprocess executor. The docker RIE executor is documented as unsupported — AWS RIE itself drops X-Ray, the pool reuses containers so a baked env would go stale — and now logs a warning when Active mode is configured on that path. Reported by @arivazhaganjeganathan-abc.
- **Firehose — Lambda processor invoked in the delivery pipeline** — `ProcessingConfiguration.Processors[].Type=Lambda` was persisted on the destination but never consulted at invocation time; records flowed straight to S3 without the configured transformation. The full AWS contract is now honored: per-batch event `{invocationId, deliveryStreamArn, region, records:[{recordId, approximateArrivalTimestamp, data}]}`, response `{records:[{recordId, result, data}]}` with `result ∈ {Ok, Dropped, ProcessingFailed}`. `Ok` → transformed `data` written downstream; `Dropped` / `ProcessingFailed` → omitted; Lambda not-found / crash / malformed body → records pass through unchanged (best-effort per AWS). Applies to both `PutRecord` / `PutRecordBatch` and `KinesisStreamAsSource` fan-out. Reported by @arivazhaganjeganathan-abc.
- **Cognito CUSTOM_AUTH — `issueTokens` on the cap-boundary attempt now wins over `MaxAttempts`** — a correct answer on the 3rd round (cap boundary) was being silently rejected with `Max authentication attempts exceeded` because the cap check fired before the `issueTokens` branch. The cap is meant to prevent a NEXT (4th) round, not penalize success on the boundary. Reordered: `failAuthentication` → `issueTokens` → max-attempts → next round. Applies to both `RespondToAuthChallenge` and `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`.
- **DynamoDB — AWS-canonical error-message parity across 24 operations** — `PutItem` set-duplicates now include the collection contents (`Input collection [a, a] contains duplicates.`); `UpdateItem` syntax errors carry token-context (`token: "INVALID", near: "INVALID SYNTAX"`); `Query` empty `KeyConditionExpression` short-circuits before unused-EAV; `Scan` `Limit=0` quotes the value (`Value '0' at 'limit'`); `Scan` `Segment` negative path returns the standard `1 validation error detected` envelope with lowercase `segment`; redundant-parentheses check pre-fires on `FilterExpression` / `KeyConditionExpression` so empty tables still reject (rather than silently passing); `begins_with` non-string operand pre-validated at parse time. `BatchExecuteStatement` per-statement `Error.Code` now drops the `Exception` suffix to match `BatchStatementErrorCodeEnum` (`DuplicateItem` / `ResourceNotFound`). `TransactGetItems` reports per-action missing-key errors via `TransactionCanceledException` cancellation reasons (not a request-level error). `CreateTable` `>2 KeySchema` error dumps the Java-toString `KeySchemaElement(attributeName=…, keyType=…)` shape. `GetItem` / `TransactGetItems` `ProjectionExpression` parses syntactically + rejects reserved keywords up front. `UpdateItem` pre-rejects mutation of hash / range key attributes regardless of whether the item exists. `BatchWriteItem` / `TransactWriteItems` / `TransactGetItems` size-exceeded errors include the AWS-shape Java-toString dump in the envelope.

---

## [1.3.55] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **AWS Elemental MediaConnect — control-plane stub** — `CreateFlow`, `DescribeFlow`, `ListFlows`, `UpdateFlow`, `ListTagsForResource` at `/v1/flows[/{FlowArn}]` and `/tags/{ResourceArn}`. `ListFlows` returns the slimmer AWS `ListedFlow` projection (no Outputs/Sources/Entitlements); `UpdateFlow` is narrow to the AWS-allowed top-level fields (`SourceFailoverConfig`, `Maintenance`, `SourceMonitoringConfig`, `NdiConfig`); flow records use the wire-form camelCase keys per the AWS REST-JSON model. No real streaming/transcoder — flows are control-plane metadata, enough to integration-test services that wrap the MediaConnect API. Reported by @tashif-hoda.
- **EKS `AssociateEncryptionConfig` + OIDC discovery / JWKS for IRSA** — new `POST /clusters/{name}/encryption-config/associate` returns an `update` envelope and rejects re-association (matches AWS, which only allows adding encryption to a cluster that has none). Cluster `identity.oidc.issuer` now points at a ministack-hosted URL (`/oidc/id/{32-char-id}`) instead of the real `oidc.eks.{region}.amazonaws.com` (unreachable from clients); `GET <issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration` and `GET <issuer>/keys` are served at the AWS-shape paths, with `authorization_endpoint: "urn:kubernetes:programmatic_authorization"` and `claims_supported: ["sub","iss"]` matching the real EKS discovery document. A single RSA keypair is generated lazily on first request and shared across clusters — sufficient for Terraform's `aws_iam_openid_connect_provider` to fetch the document. Reported by @b-rajesh.

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v2 Lambda-proxy — `Set-Cookie` from `headers` and the `cookies` array now both ship** — observed real-AWS behavior is to emit the array entries first followed by any `Set-Cookie` carried in `headers`; the earlier supersede approach silently dropped the header cookie. Case-insensitive on the header key.Contributed by @rmlasseter.
- **API Gateway v2 Lambda-proxy — `isBase64Encoded` honored in both directions** — request bodies for binary content types are now base64-encoded with `isBase64Encoded: true`; response bodies marked `isBase64Encoded: true` are decoded to raw bytes (HTTP API v2 has no `binaryMediaTypes` negotiation — it's unconditional). The text/binary split for the request body (only `text/*` and `application/json` / `application/xml` / `application/javascript` arrive as UTF-8 strings; everything else, including a missing `Content-Type` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, is base64) matches the AWS-observed behavior. Contributed by @rmlasseter.
- **API Gateway v1 Lambda-proxy — `binaryMediaTypes` is now wired** — request bodies whose `Content-Type` matches a configured `binaryMediaType` are delivered base64-encoded with `isBase64Encoded: true`; response bodies with `isBase64Encoded: true` are decoded to raw bytes only when the request `Accept` also matches a `binaryMediaType`. `binaryMediaTypes` was stored on the API record but inert at invocation before this. Wildcards (`*/*`, `type/*`) honored on the configured side; a request value of `*/*` does NOT auto-match specific configured types — verified against real AWS. Contributed by @rmlasseter.
- **API Gateway v2 Lambda-proxy — case-insensitive header override** — a lowercase `content-type` (or any case-mismatched header) from a Lambda response now replaces ministack's seeded default rather than shipping a duplicate header. HTTP field names are case-insensitive per RFC 9110 §5.1. Contributed by @rmlasseter.
- **API Gateway v1 Lambda-proxy — case-insensitive header override** — same fix on the `headers` merge for REST APIs: the v1 builder previously case-folded only the `multiValueHeaders` merge, so a lowercase `content-type` shipped twice; it now overrides the default and is emitted once. Contributed by @rmlasseter.

## [1.3.54] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **EKS addons** — `CreateAddon`, `DescribeAddon`, `ListAddons`, `UpdateAddon`, `DeleteAddon` at `/clusters/{name}/addons[/{addonName}[/update]]`. Status flips to `ACTIVE` on create / update (the same shortcut the nodegroup path already uses — Terraform polls until `ACTIVE` so a slow-roll status would only stall plans). Tags + persistence wired through the existing patterns. Unblocks `aws_eks_addon` for the standard cluster bootstrap (`vpc-cni`, `coredns`, `kube-proxy`, `aws-ebs-csi-driver`). Reported by @b-rajesh.

### Fixed
- **API Gateway Lambda-proxy `Set-Cookie` and `multiValueHeaders` now reach the client** — v2 maps the payload-format-2.0 `cookies` array to a list-valued `Set-Cookie` (RFC 6265 §3 forbids comma-folding); v1 folds the format-1.0 `multiValueHeaders` into the response with multiValueHeaders winning over `headers` on key collision per the AWS contract; `app.py:_send_response` expands list-valued headers into one wire line per entry. Collision check is case-insensitive (HTTP headers are case-insensitive per RFC 7230 §3.2), so `Set-Cookie` in `headers` plus `set-cookie` in `multiValueHeaders` correctly resolves to MVH wins instead of shipping both. Contributed by @rmlasseter.
- **DynamoDB data-plane table-name length range** — `PutItem` / `GetItem` / `UpdateItem` / `DeleteItem` / `Query` / `Scan` now accept the AWS-documented 1..255 range (the 3-char minimum is a control-plane-only rule on `CreateTable`). NULL-attribute error message text aligned to `"Null attribute value types must have the value of true"`.
- **EC2 launch template version XML shape** — `CreateLaunchTemplateVersion` returns a single `<launchTemplateVersion>` struct; `DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions` wraps the same struct in `<launchTemplateVersionSet><item>…</item></launchTemplateVersionSet>`. The `<item>` wrapper now belongs at the list-context boundary, not on the inner struct — matching the AWS Query-protocol response. Reported by @b-rajesh.

---

## [1.3.53] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Firehose `KinesisStreamAsSource` → S3 fan-out** — delivery streams of type `KinesisStreamAsSource` with an `ExtendedS3` / `S3` destination now actually consume records from the source Kinesis stream and forward them to S3. Previously the source configuration round-tripped on `DescribeDeliveryStream` but no consumer ever read the records. Fan-out fires inline from Kinesis `PutRecord` / `PutRecords` (same pattern as SNS→SQS), honors `Prefix` and `DeliveryStartTimestamp`, and is best-effort so it can't break the producer. Reported by @arivazhaganjeganathan-abc.

### Fixed
- **DynamoDB error-message conformance against dynamodb-conformance.org Tier 3** — 30+ message-text fixes so the exact AWS strings are returned. Highlights: `BatchWriteItem`/`BatchGetItem` empty `RequestItems` (`"The requestItems parameter is required."`); over-limit batches now use the canonical `1 validation error detected: …` format; non-existent-table responses across `Get`/`Put`/`Delete`/`Update`/`Scan`/`Batch*`/`Transact*` all return `"Requested resource not found"`; empty `KeyConditionExpression` / `UpdateExpression` use the `"Invalid {Expression}: The expression cannot be empty;"` template; undefined `:val` / `#name` references are now scoped to the specific expression (`"Invalid FilterExpression: An expression attribute value used in expression is not defined; attribute value: :v"`); `ExpressionAttributeValues` / `ExpressionAttributeNames` without any expression use `"… can only be specified when using expressions"`; `Scan` `Segment` validation uses AWS's exact phrasing; set-duplicate / NULL / empty-BS / `KeySchema` / LSI-on-hash-only / duplicate-index-name / billingMode / tableClass / deletion-protection / `Limit` / GSI-not-found messages all aligned. Empty binary is now accepted in non-key attributes per the AWS data-types reference. `ListTagsOfResource` on a syntactically-valid but non-existent ARN returns `AccessDeniedException` (security-through-obscurity — `TagResource` / `UntagResource` keep `ResourceNotFoundException`).
- **DynamoDB projection and parallel-scan correctness** — GSI / LSI `INCLUDE` and `KEYS_ONLY` projections are now enforced on `Query` and `Scan` (items trimmed to declared `NonKeyAttributes` + keys); parallel `Scan` partitions items deterministically across segments by hashing the partition key (previously every segment returned every item); LSI sparse semantics drop items lacking the index range-key attribute.
- **EFS resource-not-found errors are now per-resource-type** — `TagResource` / `UntagResource` / `ListTagsForResource` return `FileSystemNotFound` (404) for `fs-*` ARNs, `AccessPointNotFound` (404) for `fsap-*`, and `BadRequest` (400) for unrecognised EFS resources, matching the AWS API reference.
- **S3 Tables** `NoSuchNamespaceException` / `NoSuchTableException` → `NotFoundException` (canonical S3 Tables shape).
- **CloudFront KeyValueStore** routing fallback → `ValidationException` (was the invented `InvalidRequestException`).
- **API Gateway v1** `MethodNotAllowedException` (405) → `BadRequestException` (400) on the unsupported-method branch — APIGW v1 doesn't define a 405 exception in its model.
- **ECS** `InvalidRequest` / `ServiceAlreadyExists` → `ClientException` (AWS ECS uses `ClientException` as the client-error catch-all).
- **AWS Batch** routing fallback → `ClientException` (only `ClientException` / `ServerException` are in the Batch model).
- **MWAA** `InvalidRequestException` / `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` → `ValidationException` (the MWAA model exposes neither).
- **OpenSearch** JSON-parse errors → `ValidationException` (was the invented `InvalidPayloadException`).
- **Account** routing fallback → `ValidationException` (was `InvalidRequest`).
- **KMS, MWAA, Inspector2** no longer leak Python exception text — generic catch blocks were forwarding `str(e)` as the AWS error message on `InvalidCiphertextException` / `InternalServerException` / `InternalServerError`. Responses are now opaque per AWS convention.
- **IMDS instance-profile ID literal is now assembled at runtime** — credential-pattern secret scanners (e.g. AquaSec) were false-flagging the `AIPA…` literal in `imds.py` as a leaked instance-profile ID. The 20-character wire response is unchanged; the source no longer contains a contiguous `AIPA…` string. Reported by @diplomatic-ms.

---

## [1.3.52] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Lambda Durable Functions (Durable Execution)** — full support for the AWS Lambda durable functions preview API (`2025-12-01`), including `CreateFunction` with `DurableConfig`, `CheckpointDurableExecution`, `GetDurableExecutionState`, `GetDurableExecution`, `GetDurableExecutionHistory`, `ListDurableExecutionsByFunction`, `StopDurableExecution`, and the three external callback ops `SendDurableExecutionCallbackSuccess`, `SendDurableExecutionCallbackFailure`, `SendDurableExecutionCallbackHeartbeat`. End-to-end verified against the official `aws-durable-execution-sdk-python` (1.5.0) and `aws-durable-execution-sdk-java` (2.44.13). A resume scheduler fires `WAIT` expiries, callback timeouts (`Callback.Timeout` / `Callback.Heartbeat`), and step-retry backoffs (`NextAttemptDelaySeconds`). State persists across restarts — the in-memory callback index is rebuilt from restored executions on boot and pending timers are re-armed. Reported by @youngkwangk.
- **S3 object tagging by `versionId`** — `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` `?tagging` honor the `versionId` query parameter, and `PutObject` / `POST` form upload now store the `x-amz-tagging` header against the resulting version rather than the object key, matching AWS's versioned-tagging semantics. Reported by @barrywilks7.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::AppConfig::Application`** — create and delete provisioners for the AppConfig application resource type, wired into the existing CloudFormation dispatcher. Reported by @zmartinec.

### Fixed
- **DynamoDB gap closing** — additional alignment work across DynamoDB validators and response shapes.
- **Lambda durable `MaxItems` pagination** — `ListDurableExecutionsByFunction`, `GetDurableExecutionState`, and `GetDurableExecutionHistory` now return 400 `InvalidParameterValueException` when `MaxItems` is outside the AWS-documented `[0, 1000]` range, instead of silently clamping.
- **Lambda durable `CheckpointDurableExecution` validation** — `OperationUpdate` entries with missing `Id`/`Type`/`Action` or with a `Type` outside `EXECUTION`/`CONTEXT`/`STEP`/`WAIT`/`CALLBACK`/`CHAINED_INVOKE` are rejected with 400 `InvalidParameterValueException` instead of being silently stored as garbage operations.
- **Lambda durable `StopDurableExecution` on terminal** — calling Stop on an already-terminal execution returns 400 `InvalidParameterValueException` per the AWS-documented "Stops a running durable execution" contract.

---

## [1.3.51] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- **DynamoDB Backups** — `CreateBackup`, `DescribeBackup`, `DeleteBackup`, `ListBackups`, `RestoreTableFromBackup`, and `RestoreTableToPointInTime`. Restore rebuilds the target table with the snapshot's items, key schema, and indexes; `BillingModeOverride`, `GlobalSecondaryIndexOverride`, and `LocalSecondaryIndexOverride` are honored. State persists across restarts via the existing ministack persistence hooks.
- **DynamoDB Export / Import** — `ExportTableToPointInTime`, `DescribeExport`, `ListExports`, `ImportTable`, `DescribeImport`, `ListImports`. Both ops are idempotent on `ClientToken`. The emulator completes exports synchronously and re-creates the destination table from `TableCreationParameters` on import. Driven by the dynamodb-conformance.org gap report.
- **DynamoDB Contributor Insights** — `UpdateContributorInsights`, `DescribeContributorInsights`, `ListContributorInsights`. ENABLING→ENABLED and DISABLING→DISABLED state machine matches the way real AWS settles status on subsequent `Describe` calls; optional `IndexName` is validated against the table's GSI list.
- **DynamoDB Resource-Based Policies** — `PutResourcePolicy`, `GetResourcePolicy`, `DeleteResourcePolicy` with full revision-id semantics. `ExpectedRevisionId` mismatches raise `PolicyNotFoundException`, including the `NO_POLICY` conditional path documented in the AWS API reference. Policy size is capped at 20 KB per the AWS quota.
- **DynamoDB PartiQL transactions and batches** — `BatchExecuteStatement` and `ExecuteTransaction`, including `ClientRequestToken` idempotency, all-or-nothing rollback on any statement failure, and `DuplicateItemException` on `INSERT` against an existing primary key. `ExecuteStatement` now also returns `ConsumedCapacity` when `ReturnConsumedCapacity` is set.
- **DynamoDB `DescribeLimits`** — returns canonical account- and table-level read/write capacity limits.
- **EC2 `CreateSecurityGroup` returns `SecurityGroupArn`, `DeleteSecurityGroup` returns the deleted `GroupId`, and `RevokeSecurityGroupEgress` returns `RevokedSecurityGroupRules`** — security group lifecycle responses now carry the fields real AWS emits, so workflows that inspect create / revoke / delete output get the same shapes as production. Contributed by @Areson.

### Fixed
- **DynamoDB item-level validation** — `PutItem`, `BatchWriteItem`, and `TransactWriteItems` now reject empty `SS` / `NS` / `BS`, duplicate set elements, and empty strings for hash or sort key values. Numbers are canonicalized (leading-zero strip, negative-zero normalization, trailing-decimal trim) and bounded to 38 significant digits and magnitude `[1E-130, 9.9999...E+125]`. The 400 KB item-size cap is now enforced with attribute names contributing to the total per the AWS Developer Guide accounting.
- **DynamoDB batch caps** — `BatchWriteItem` rejects more than 25 requests, `BatchGetItem` rejects more than 100 keys, both with the AWS-canonical validation error. Duplicate target keys are rejected in both ops, and `BatchGetItem` against a non-existent table now raises `ResourceNotFoundException` up front instead of silently routing the table to `UnprocessedKeys`.
- **DynamoDB transaction caps and accounting** — `TransactWriteItems` and `TransactGetItems` cap at 100 actions, `TransactWriteItems` caps at 4 MB total payload, both reject duplicate target keys, and both return `ConsumedCapacity` at 2× the per-item rate per the AWS Developer Guide. `ClientRequestToken` idempotency raises `IdempotentParameterMismatchException` on payload mismatch.
- **DynamoDB `CreateTable` validation** — table name pattern `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+` and length 3-255, exactly one `HASH` and at most one `RANGE` in `KeySchema`, every key attribute must appear in `AttributeDefinitions` with no unused entries, duplicate `IndexName` across LSI/GSI rejected, LSIs require a `RANGE` key on the base table and must use the same `HASH` key, `BillingMode` enum enforced, `ProvisionedThroughput` only allowed on `PROVISIONED` tables. `TableClass`, `OnDemandThroughput`, and AWS-managed-key `SSEDescription` now round-trip via `DescribeTable`.
- **DynamoDB `UpdateTable` validation** — rejects PROVISIONED → PROVISIONED no-op, rejects `ProvisionedThroughput` with `PAY_PER_REQUEST`, rejects zero or negative capacity values, validates `TableClass` enum, adds GSI duplicate-name and undefined-attribute detection, and returns `ResourceNotFoundException` when deleting or updating a non-existent GSI. `OnDemandThroughput` changes round-trip via `DescribeTable`. Deletion protection on `DeleteTable` is enforced.
- **DynamoDB `Query` validation** — `KeyConditionExpression` may only reference key attributes (returns `Query condition missed key schema element` on violation), empty `KeyConditionExpression` rejected, `Select` enum enforced (`ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` only on an indexed query, `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` requires a `ProjectionExpression` or `AttributesToGet`), `ConsistentRead=true` on a GSI rejected, `Limit >= 1` enforced, malformed `ExclusiveStartKey` rejected.
- **DynamoDB `Scan` validation** — `Segment` / `TotalSegments` co-requirement and range checks, `Limit >= 1`, `ConsistentRead` on a GSI rejected, `Select` enum same as `Query`, `ScanFilter` + `FilterExpression` mutually exclusive, `AttributesToGet` + `ProjectionExpression` mutually exclusive.
- **DynamoDB `UpdateItem` semantics** — `SET` references now resolve against the pre-update snapshot of the item (so `SET a = b, b = :v` assigns the OLD value of `b` to `a`), an intermediate path that doesn't exist is rejected, hash- and range-key attribute mutation is rejected, `REMOVE` with `ReturnValues=UPDATED_NEW` omits `Attributes` from the response (no new values to report), and empty `UpdateExpression` is rejected.
- **DynamoDB `GetItem` `ProjectionExpression` honors nested paths** — nested map paths (`level1.level2.leaf`), list indexes (`items[1]`), combined nested + index (`rec.tags[0]`), and multiple sibling paths under the same root all return the correctly-pruned attribute tree instead of the whole root attribute.
- **DynamoDB `ReturnValues` and `ReturnItemCollectionMetrics` per op** — invalid `ReturnValues` enum is rejected per op (`PutItem` and `DeleteItem` only accept `NONE` and `ALL_OLD`), invalid `ReturnItemCollectionMetrics` rejected, and `SIZE` returns the AWS shape `{ItemCollectionKey, SizeEstimateRangeGB}` on tables with at least one LSI.
- **DynamoDB binary keys order bytewise and `size()` counts UTF-16 code units** — binary sort keys are compared after base64 decoding so `b'\x01' < b'\xff'`, `begins_with` on binary now decodes both operands before comparing prefixes, and `size(s)` returns the UTF-16 code-unit count for strings (a surrogate-pair emoji counts as 2) and the decoded byte length for binary, matching the AWS Developer Guide.
- **DynamoDB rejects unaliased AWS reserved keywords in expressions** — every bare identifier in `ConditionExpression`, `UpdateExpression`, `FilterExpression`, `KeyConditionExpression`, or `ProjectionExpression` that matches the canonical AWS DynamoDB reserved-word list is now rejected with `Attribute name is a reserved keyword; reserved keyword: <word>`. Users must alias the name via `ExpressionAttributeNames` exactly as with real AWS.
- **DynamoDB rejects redundant parentheses and `contains(x, x)`** — the `((expr))` pattern is rejected across all expression fields (returns the AWS "expression has redundant parentheses" validator), and `contains()` with structurally identical operands is rejected with the AWS "operands must be distinct" message.
- **DynamoDB `ExpressionAttributeNames` / `ExpressionAttributeValues` bookkeeping** — every defined `#alias` and `:placeholder` must be referenced by some expression in the request, and every `#alias` or `:placeholder` used in an expression must be defined. Mismatches return the AWS-canonical "unused" or "not defined" validation error instead of silently passing.
- **DynamoDB PartiQL `INSERT` against an existing item now raises `DuplicateItemException`** — previously emitted `ConditionalCheckFailedException`. Matches the error code listed in botocore's `ExecuteStatement` service-2.json shape.
- **DynamoDB `TagResource` / `UntagResource` / `ListTagsOfResource` validate the `ResourceArn`** — non-DynamoDB ARNs and ARNs pointing at non-existent tables now return `ValidationException` and `ResourceNotFoundException` respectively, instead of silently storing tags against a phantom resource.
- **DynamoDB `UpdateTimeToLive` rejects empty `AttributeName`** — matches AWS shape validation.
- **EC2 `DescribeSecurityGroups` distinguishes malformed IDs from missing ones** — malformed security group IDs now return `InvalidGroupId.Malformed` and valid-looking but unknown IDs continue to return `InvalidGroup.NotFound`, matching the way AWS classifies the two failure modes. Contributed by @Areson.
- **Glue `StartJobRun` no longer auto-pulls a missing image** — Spark jobs that target a Glue Docker image now check whether the image is already present locally and stub the run to `SUCCEEDED` when it is not, instead of triggering a multi-gigabyte pull on the request path.
- **MWAA worker containers auto-remove on exit** — Airflow task containers spawned by the MWAA emulator now self-clean instead of leaving stopped containers on the Docker daemon after every DAG run.

---

## [1.3.50] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- **S3 Tables (`s3tables`)** — new service emulator for the AWS S3 Tables API: table buckets, namespaces, and Iceberg-format tables. Control plane covers `CreateTableBucket`, `ListTableBuckets`, `GetTableBucket`, `DeleteTableBucket`, `CreateNamespace`, `ListNamespaces`, `GetNamespace`, `DeleteNamespace`, `CreateTable`, `ListTables`, `GetTable`, `DeleteTable`, `GetTableMetadataLocation`, `UpdateTableMetadataLocation`. Ships with an embedded **Iceberg REST catalog** at `/iceberg` so Spark jobs configured with `spark.sql.catalog.*.type=rest` and `spark.sql.catalog.*.uri=http://<ministack>/iceberg` can create, load, and commit Iceberg tables without an external catalog server. Data files land in MiniStack's S3 service; table metadata (schemas, snapshots, manifests) lives in memory.
- **Glue Spark jobs run on the official `amazon/aws-glue-libs` PySpark image** — `GlueVersion: 4.0` and `3.0` map to their canonical AWS Glue images (`glue_libs_4.0.0_image_01` / `glue_libs_3.0.0_image_01`); override the image via `GLUE_DOCKER_IMAGE`. Job containers run on MiniStack's Docker network so they reach S3, RDS, and other ministack services by container hostname.
- **IAM `UpdateAccessKey`** — enables toggling an access key between `Active` and `Inactive`, matching the two statuses the real AWS API accepts. Optional `UserName` is validated when provided. Contributed by @lahmish.
- **IAM `GetAccessKeyLastUsed`** — returns the AWS "never used" shape (`Region`/`ServiceName` = `N/A`, no `LastUsedDate`) since MiniStack does not track per-key usage history. Contributed by @lahmish.

### Fixed
- **Lambda invocation log includes user output alongside the traceback on error** — when a handler raised after printing, the response log dropped the user output and only returned the traceback. Both are now returned, newline-separated, matching real Lambda CloudWatch Logs output. Contributed by @Baptiste-Garcin.
- **EC2 `CreateVpcEndpoint` and `CreateFlowLogs` now persist `TagSpecifications`** — tags passed at creation time were silently dropped. Tags are now stored, returned by `DescribeFlowLogs`, and cleaned up on `DeleteFlowLogs`. The `fl-` prefix is also registered in the resource-type guesser so flow-log IDs are correctly resolved by the Resource Groups Tagging API. Contributed by @lahmish.

---

## [1.3.49] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Amazon Inspector2** — new service emulator with 14 API operations: `Enable`, `Disable`, `ListFindings` (with filtering, sorting, pagination), `BatchGetFindingDetails`, `ListCoverage`, `ListCoverageStatistics`, `ListFindingAggregations`, `SearchVulnerabilities`, `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, `ListTagsForResource`, `CreateFilter`, `ListFilters`, `DeleteFilter`. Generates deterministic stub vulnerability findings for ECR container images, Lambda functions, and EC2 instances when enabled. Contributed by @ry-allan.
- **RDS auto-respawn at boot** — when `PERSIST_STATE=1` and an `rds.json` state file exists, MiniStack now eager-imports the RDS module at startup and respawns the Docker container for every persisted instance immediately, with no client API call required. Previously the module loaded lazily on the first RDS request, leaving the postgres/mysql container down until the user happened to call an `awslocal rds` operation. Zero idle cost when no RDS state file is present (the conditional skips the import entirely). Reported by @doodaz.
- **Glue `CreateTable` persists `ViewOriginalText` / `ViewExpandedText`** — views created via `CreateTable` (the path used by Trino, Spark, and Athena) lost their SQL body because `_create_table` ignored both fields. `GetTable` now returns them, unblocking Trino's iceberg connector and other engines that fail with `viewOriginalText must be present`. Contributed by @yonatoasis.
- **Glue `CreateTable` / `UpdateTable` persist `ViewDefinition` and `IsMultiDialectView`** — newer multi-dialect view clients (Spark 3.4+, Glue 4.0 jobs, Lake Formation cross-engine views) round-trip the full view definition instead of seeing it silently dropped on create.

### Fixed
- **AppSync Events resources persist across restarts with `PERSIST_STATE=1`** — Event APIs, channel namespaces, and API keys created against the AppSync Events endpoint (`/v2/apis`) were silently dropped on container restart because `appsync_events.json` was never written at shutdown. State is now saved and restored on every restart, matching the behavior of every other persisted service. Same fix covers a related class of restart drops for `apigateway_v1` on first boot and for services reached only via inter-service calls (Lambda-auto-created CloudWatch log groups, EventBridge targets fired by S3 notifications). Reported by @yaegassy.
- **RDS respawn after restart no longer fails with `port is already allocated`** — restored DB instances tried to bind the engine's standard port (5432 for postgres, 3306 for mysql) on the host instead of the original docker host port, so every restart with persisted state left the instance in `failed`. The host port is now tracked separately on the instance, validated as free before reuse, and falls back to a fresh free port if something else has taken it. Stale `Created`-status containers from prior failed boots are force-removed before respawn so they don't hold the binding. Reported by @doodaz.
- **CloudFront `ListDistributions` round-trips origin configuration** — `DistributionSummary` now includes `Origins` and `DefaultCacheBehavior` from the stored distribution config, so custom origins round-trip consistently across create, get, list, and update flows. Contributed by @CoffeeRaptor.
- **CloudFront `DistributionSummary` emits all AWS-required fields** — `Aliases`, `CacheBehaviors`, `CustomErrorResponses`, `PriceClass`, `ViewerCertificate`, `Restrictions`, `WebACLId`, `HttpVersion`, `IsIPV6Enabled`, and `Staging` are now emitted alongside the fields above. When a field wasn't set on the original `CreateDistributionConfig`, ministack emits a minimal-but-valid default (empty `Quantity=0` containers, `CloudFrontDefaultCertificate=true`, `HttpVersion=http2`) so strict-parsing SDKs (Go v2, Java v2) don't reject the response.

---

## [1.3.48] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **S3 `GetObjectAcl` and `PutObjectAcl`** — both `?acl` subresource operations are now implemented. `GetObjectAcl` returns the stored policy or, if none has been set, the AWS default of a single `FULL_CONTROL` Grant to the request's account-id owner. `PutObjectAcl` accepts either a canned ACL via the `x-amz-acl` header (`private`, `public-read`, `public-read-write`, `authenticated-read`, `aws-exec-read`, `bucket-owner-read`, `bucket-owner-full-control`) or a full `<AccessControlPolicy>` XML body; invalid canned values return `InvalidArgument` and malformed bodies return `MalformedACLError`. As with retention, legal-hold and bucket policies, the policy is stored and round-tripped but not enforced on the data plane. `NoSuchKey` returned for missing keys, matching the only error modeled in botocore. Reported by @smpial.

### Fixed
- **RDS persistence-restore module-import race** — the v1.3.47 restore-respawn threads called `_get_docker()` which was defined further down in the same module, so a thread reaching the lookup before the parser finished raised `NameError: name '_get_docker' is not defined` and stranded the restored instance in `creating`. The `load_state("rds")` block now runs at the bottom of the module, after every helper the restore threads can touch. Reported by @doodaz.

---

## [1.3.47] — 2026-05-23

### Added
- **CloudFormation nested stacks** — `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resources now provision their child template (fetched from `TemplateURL`), pass `Parameters` through, expose child `Outputs` via `Fn::GetAtt: [Nested, Outputs.<Name>]`, and cascade delete/update with the parent. `Ref` of the nested resource resolves to the child stack ARN, matching real AWS. Reported by @jayalfredprufrock.

### Fixed
- **CloudFront invalidations** — repeated `CreateInvalidation` calls with the same `CallerReference` now return the existing invalidation for that distribution; path comparison is set-based so re-submitting the same paths in a different order is treated as idempotent rather than as a divergent batch. Contributed by @CoffeeRaptor.
- **S3 `DeleteObjects`** — objects deleted in a batch are now removed from disk, mirroring `DeleteObject`. Contributed by @parafoxia.
- **RDS persistence-restore** — backing Docker containers are now respawned for persisted DB instances at restart, with status flowing `creating → available/failed` based on container liveness instead of staying frozen as zombie metadata. Per-instance threads now carry the original account context so multi-tenant restores land writes on the correct account. Reported by @doodaz.
- **Cognito `/oauth2/idpresponse` and `/saml2/idpresponse`** — distinct error messages and a server-side WARNING log when the OIDC `state` / SAML `RelayState` doesn't match any pending authorize flow, so configuration drift (expired or unknown state) is diagnosable without staring at an opaque `InvalidParameterException`. Reported by @ocr-lasagna.
- **Cognito `/{poolId}/.well-known/jwks.json` and `/{poolId}/.well-known/openid-configuration`** no longer shadow S3 — these endpoints now fall through to the S3 handler when the pool prefix doesn't match a registered user pool, so apps storing their own `.well-known/*` documents in an S3 bucket get the actual object back instead of a fake Cognito JWKS. Real AWS only serves these for actual pools.

---

## [1.3.46] — 2026-05-21

### Added
- **S3 `PutObject` conditional writes** — `If-None-Match: "*"` (create-once) and `If-Match: "<etag>"` (optimistic concurrency) are now enforced on `PutObject`, matching the AWS feature shipped November 2024. Precondition violations return 412 `PreconditionFailed`, except `If-Match: "<etag>"` against a missing key which returns 404 `NoSuchKey` per the AWS user guide. ETag comparison strips surrounding quotes on both sides. The symmetric `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` headers on `CopyObject` were already supported; this closes the gap on plain `PutObject`. Contributed by @mattcookio.

### Fixed
- **Cognito JWT `iss` claim uses the pool's region, not the request region** — when a SigV4 scope carried a different region from the pool's creation region, the JWT `iss` mismatched the pool ID prefix and standards-compliant validators rejected the token. A new `_pool_region(pool_id)` resolver parses the region from the pool ID (`{region}_{suffix}`) and is applied to the `iss` claim, the PreTokenGeneration trigger event region, the user-pool ARN, the OIDC discovery `issuer`, and the hosted-UI CloudFront URL on `CreateUserPoolDomain` / `DescribeUserPoolDomain`. The parser accepts 3-segment commercial regions and 4-segment GovCloud / ISO regions (`us-gov-east-1`, `us-iso-east-1`, etc.). Contributed by @subrotosanyal.

---

## [1.3.45] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **CloudWatch Logs `GetLogEvents` / `FilterLogEvents` accept `logGroupIdentifier`** — both ops now resolve the target log group from the AWS-documented `logGroupIdentifier` parameter (either the bare group name or a full `arn:aws:logs:<region>:<account>:log-group:<name>[:*]` ARN), as well as the original `logGroupName`. Calls that pass an ARN — common from AWS SDK code that has the group ARN handy — no longer fail with `ResourceNotFoundException: The specified log group does not exist: None`. Reported by @msulima.
- **ElastiCache `DescribeCacheClusters` emits full `CacheNode` shape** — the per-node XML now includes `CacheNodeCreateTime` (ISO8601), `ParameterGroupStatus`, `CustomerAvailabilityZone` (derived from the cluster's preferred AZ), and `SourceCacheNodeId` (when non-empty) in addition to the previous `CacheNodeId` / `CacheNodeStatus` / `Endpoint`. `hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws` v6.45.0 deref's `CacheNodeCreateTime` without a nil check during read after `aws_elasticache_cluster` apply, causing `Unexpected nil pointer in: {CacheNodeCreateTime:<nil> …}` and preventing Terraform from confirming cluster availability. Reported by @trackme-ddisley.
- **API Gateway v1 `UpdateStage` boolean fields parsed from patch strings** — AWS sends `patchOperations[].value` as strings, but the v1 PATCH handler previously assigned them as-is via the generic patch path. SDK clients (e.g. Pulumi / AWS SDK Go v2) that read back `tracingEnabled` and `cacheClusterEnabled` then failed deserialization with `expected Boolean to be of type *bool, got string instead`. Those two root-stage fields are now coerced to `bool` (`"true"` → `True`) before being applied, with an exact path match so a stage variable named `tracingEnabled` is unaffected.

## [1.3.44] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Standard AWS ECS Docker labels on `RunTask` containers** — every container MiniStack spawns for an ECS task now carries the five canonical `com.amazonaws.ecs.*` labels real ECS sets (cluster ARN, container-name, task-arn, task-definition-family, task-definition-version), matching the keys and values documented in the AWS ECS container metadata file spec. Lets host-side log shippers, monitoring agents, and `docker ps --filter "label=…"` queries identify containers the same way they would against real ECS. Contributed by @YakirOren.
- **Step Functions JSONata standard library expanded** — the JSONata evaluator now ships every built-in function called out in the ticket, plus the parity-edge cases AWS/JSONata require: string (`$uppercase`, `$lowercase`, `$substring`, `$trim`, `$contains`, `$split`, `$join`, `$replace`, `$pad`), numeric (`$sum`, `$average`, `$max`, `$min`, `$abs`, `$floor`, `$ceil`, `$round`, `$power`, `$sqrt`, `$formatNumber`), array (`$sort` — including the `function($l, $r){...}` comparator form — `$reverse`, `$distinct`, `$append`), object (`$keys`, `$values`, `$lookup` over both objects and arrays-of-objects, `$exists` distinguishing missing paths from explicit `null` per JSONata spec), type (`$type`, `$boolean` — falsy for arrays of only-falsy values), date/time (`$now()` / `$now(picture)` / `$now(picture, timezone)` with the XPath-3.1 picture-string subset, `$millis`), and utility (`$uuid`, `$base64encode`, `$base64decode`). `$contains`, `$split`, and `$replace` accept JSONata regex literals (`/pattern/flags`), with `$1`/`$&` substitution refs supported in `$replace`. The headline ticket example `"Condition": "{% $exists($states.input.userId) %}"` now routes correctly whether the field is present, explicitly `null`, or missing. Implemented natively in Python with no new runtime dependency. Reported by @youngkwangk.

### Fixed
- **RDS Data API no longer acknowledges writes through the SQL stub for real containers that are still booting** — when a Docker-backed RDS instance is configured but its container is still bootstrapping, `ExecuteStatement` / `BatchExecuteStatement` previously fell back to the in-memory SQL stub on any connection error and returned a 200 acknowledging `CREATE USER` / `GRANT` statements that never reached MySQL. The fallback now only applies to control-plane-only clusters (no real container). Container-backed clusters whose endpoint can't be reached surface `DatabaseUnavailableException` (HTTP 504, the canonical AWS error code), so callers see the same transient-error shape they'd see against real RDS. Real SQL errors (lock-wait timeout, etc.) still surface as `BadRequestException`, not transient-unavailable. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **`CreateDBInstance` returns immediately with `DBInstanceStatus="creating"` for Docker-backed instances**, matching real AWS — readiness finalisation runs on a daemon thread and transitions the instance to `available` or `failed` based on container liveness. Previously the call blocked inline for up to 60s. Image-side password mismatches (auth-denied during the readiness probe) log at WARNING with a remediation hint.
- **RDS Aurora MySQL local endpoint and master-user parity** — Aurora cluster endpoints now track the reachable backing DB instance endpoint after cluster members are created, so Lambda containers using `DescribeDBClusters.Endpoint` can connect to MiniStack-backed databases. MySQL and Aurora MySQL containers also grant the configured master username AWS/RDS-like global privileges after the server is reachable, with version-specific dynamic privileges treated as best-effort. Contributed by @jayjanssen.

---

## [1.3.43] — 2026-05-18

### Added
- **AWS IoT Core (Phase 1)** — new service covering the control plane and a WebSocket-only MQTT data plane. Control plane: `CreateThing` / `DescribeThing` / `ListThings` / `UpdateThing` / `DeleteThing`, `CreateThingType` and group, `CreateThingGroup` + `AddThingToThingGroup` / `RemoveThingFromThingGroup`, certificates via a new in-process Local CA (`CreateKeysAndCertificate`, `RegisterCertificate`, `UpdateCertificate`, `DeleteCertificate`, `ListCertificates`), `AttachThingPrincipal` / `DetachThingPrincipal` / `ListThingPrincipals` / `ListPrincipalThings`, policies with versioning (`CreatePolicy`, `CreatePolicyVersion`, `GetPolicyVersion`, `ListPolicyVersions`, `SetDefaultPolicyVersion`, `DeletePolicyVersion`), policy attachment (`AttachPolicy`, `DetachPolicy`, `ListAttachedPolicies`, `ListTargetsForPolicy`), and `DescribeEndpoint` returning a per-account hostname. Data plane: HTTP `iot-data Publish` at `POST /topics/{topic}` with QoS 0/1 and `?retain=true`, plus MQTT 3.1.1 over WebSocket multiplexed on the gateway port (clients use the `mqtt` Sec-WebSocket-Protocol value and connect to the address returned by `DescribeEndpoint`). Multi-tenancy enforced by transparent topic prefixing in the bridge layer — the account ID is resolved from the SigV4 credential at WebSocket upgrade and topics are prefixed before they hit the in-process pub/sub registry, so two accounts publishing to the same topic name never see each other's traffic. Persistent sessions (`cleanSession=0`), QoS 1 in-flight tracking + retransmit with DUP flag, Last Will and Testament on ungraceful disconnect, duplicate-client-id force-disconnect, and retained-message delivery on subscribe all implemented per MQTT 3.1.1. Local CA root certificate exposed at `GET /_ministack/iot/ca.pem` so test code can configure SDK trust; CA + broker state (retained messages, persistent sessions) persist across restarts when `PERSIST_STATE=1`. Deferred to later phases: Device Shadows, mTLS on 8883, `ListRetainedMessages` queries, Rules Engine, Jobs, Fleet Provisioning. IoT policy documents are stored but not enforced on the data plane. Plain TCP 1883 is intentionally not exposed (real AWS IoT requires TLS or SigV4 on every connection). Requires the `cryptography` package (declared in the `[full]` optional dependency); slim image users hit a clean `RuntimeError` on first IoT call. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **Athena ↔ Glue catalog integration + S3 result persistence** — `StartQueryExecution` now resolves `database.table` references against Glue's `GetTable` to find the underlying S3 location, so queries against Glue-managed tables work without hand-written `read_csv('s3://...')` paths. Completed query results are written to the configured `OutputLocation` as `<id>.csv` plus a `<id>.csv.metadata` companion (column names + Athena-mapped types) — the CSV file includes the column-name header row as the first line, matching real Athena's output format. Mixed queries combining Glue tables with explicit `s3://` URIs in the same statement also resolve correctly. Contributed by @m7w.

### Fixed
- **EventBridge rule targets pointing at Step Functions state machines** — targets with an ARN of the form `arn:aws:states:<region>:<account>:stateMachine:<name>` previously fell through to the "unsupported target type" warning and silently dropped events. The dispatcher now calls into the existing `stepfunctions._start_execution`, which runs the execution on a daemon thread with a `contextvars.copy_context()` snapshot so the request's account context is preserved. The transformed payload (post `Input` / `InputPath` / `InputTransformer`) is passed verbatim as the execution input, so `Input*` features work for free. `RoleArn` on the target is accepted and ignored, matching how the existing Lambda/SQS/SNS dispatchers handle it. Contributed by @DaviReisVieira.
- **Step Functions `StartExecution` accepts version and alias ARNs** — real AWS lets callers (and EventBridge targets) reference a state machine by its base ARN, a published-version ARN (`stateMachine:<name>:<version>`), or an alias ARN routed via `CreateStateMachineAlias`. Previously only the base ARN resolved — versions and aliases returned `StateMachineDoesNotExist`. A new resolver walks the base / version / alias stores; alias dispatch picks the highest-weighted version in the routing configuration (ties → first listed) for deterministic test behaviour. EventBridge → Step Functions dispatch leans on the same resolver, so EB rules pinning a target to a specific version or alias now actually fire.
- **Athena DuckDB queries no longer stall the event loop** — `StartQueryExecution` previously scheduled the DuckDB run via `asyncio.create_task`, but DuckDB's `conn.execute()` is a blocking C call so the asyncio loop sat idle for the full query duration, stalling every other in-flight request on the single-process server. Wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` so multiple concurrent Athena queries run on worker threads and the loop stays free.
- **Step Functions `aws-sdk:lambda` integration** — `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:lambda:getAlias` and `getFunctionConfiguration` now dispatch through the Lambda REST emulator with JSONPath-resolved `FunctionName`, `Name`, and `Qualifier` parameters. Unblocks readiness workflows that verify a Lambda alias and its published version before invoking it. The dispatcher captures the caller's account ID from the request contextvar and embeds it in the synthetic Authorization header (instead of hardcoding `test`), so SFN executions running under a non-default 12-digit account correctly resolve Lambdas in their own account scope. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **Lambda published-version readiness propagates from `$LATEST`** — published version snapshots created while `$LATEST` is still `Pending/InProgress` now transition to `Active/Successful` with the function, so `GetFunctionConfiguration --qualifier <version>` converges instead of staying stuck after the alias points at the version. Contributed by @jayjanssen.

---

## [1.3.42] — 2026-05-16

### Added
- **MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow)** — new service emulating the AWS MWAA REST API for both Airflow 2.x and Airflow 3.x. `CreateEnvironment` spins up a real `apache/airflow:<version>` container in standalone mode on the same Docker network as MiniStack, syncs DAGs from the configured `SourceBucketArn` + `DagS3Path` into `/opt/airflow/dags/` once the container reaches AVAILABLE, and forces an aggressive scan interval so DAGs become visible within seconds. `CreateWebLoginToken` and `CreateCliToken` return the correct field names (`WebToken` / `CliToken`) per the boto3 MWAA model. `InvokeRestApi` proxies to the running Airflow REST API — `/api/v2/` for v3 (open via Simple Auth Manager with `ALL_ADMINS=true`), `/api/v1/` for v2 (basic auth using the standalone-generated admin password captured from the container after boot). `GetEnvironment`, `UpdateEnvironment`, `ListEnvironments`, `DeleteEnvironment` and full container lifecycle (stop + remove on delete) included; per-environment host port released on delete so long-running stacks don't leak ports. Host-prefix routing (`api.airflow.<region>`) correctly bypassed by the S3 vhost extractor so requests reach the MWAA handler instead of being misread as bucket names. End-to-end verified with real DAGs visible via `InvokeRestApi GET /dags` on both Airflow 2.10.4 and Airflow 3.0.6.
- **CloudWatch Alarm `AlarmActions` → SNS publish** — alarm state transitions (`OK` ↔ `ALARM` ↔ `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`) now dispatch the configured `AlarmActions` / `OKActions` / `InsufficientDataActions` lists. SNS topic ARNs are published with the AWS-shaped JSON payload (`AlarmName`, `NewStateValue`, `NewStateReason`, `StateChangeTime`, `Region`, `OldStateValue`, `Trigger` sub-object with metric/threshold/comparison). Fires on both `SetAlarmState` (manual) and the auto-evaluation path triggered by `PutMetricData`. `ActionsEnabled=False` (or `DisableAlarmActions`) suppresses dispatch. Closes the largest single inter-service integration gap — alerting-driven testing now works end-to-end.
- **Lambda → CloudWatch Metrics** — every Lambda invocation now publishes the four canonical `AWS/Lambda` metrics dimensioned by `FunctionName`: `Invocations` (count), `Errors` (count, 1 on handled/unhandled failure), `Duration` (ms, wall-clock around the worker call), `Throttles` (count, 1 when reserved-concurrency rejected the call). Recorded for both `RequestResponse` and `Event` invocation types. Queryable via the standard `GetMetricStatistics` API, same shape and granularity real CloudWatch emits.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::ApiGateway::Account`** — the singleton CFN resource that stores `CloudWatchRoleArn` for the API Gateway account. Previously failed with `Unsupported resource type`, which blocked any CDK stack using `new RestApi({ cloudWatchRole: true })` — a very common pattern. The handler writes the role ARN into the same store the runtime `UpdateAccount` / `GetAccount` API reads from, so the value round-trips end-to-end. Reported by @sajansharmanz.

### Changed
- **Test harness — xdist session-startup reset coordination** — the per-worker `autouse` `reset_server` fixture previously had every xdist worker hit `/_ministack/reset` on session start, so a slower worker's reset could fire after a faster worker had already begun creating fixtures, wiping that state mid-test (most visibly as occasional `list_functions()` empty results in `test_lambda_create_invoke`). The first worker now wins an `O_EXCL` file lock and runs the reset; the others wait briefly for a marker file and skip. Single-process pytest (no xdist) keeps the original behaviour. Removes a class of CI flakes that only reproduced under parallel load.

---

## [1.3.41] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **KMS `Decrypt` error code on malformed ciphertext** — when the caller omitted `KeyId` and the ciphertext was too short or otherwise unparseable, MiniStack returned `NotFoundException` ("Unable to find the key for decryption"); real AWS returns `InvalidCiphertextException` in that case. The two errors are distinguished by AWS-SDK clients that catch encryption faults separately from key-lookup faults (e.g., wrapper libraries that retry on `NotFound` but surface `InvalidCiphertext` immediately). `NotFoundException` is still returned when the caller did pass an explicit `KeyId` that doesn't resolve, matching real AWS.

---

## [1.3.40] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Cognito invitation and verification emails via SES** — `AdminCreateUser`, `SignUp`, `ResendConfirmationCode`, `ForgotPassword`, and `AdminResetUserPassword` now hand their welcome / temporary-password / verification mail to the in-process SES emulator, so simulated apps see the message in `/_ministack/ses/messages` and it relays via SMTP when `SMTP_HOST` is set. Mirrors AWS behaviour: `MessageAction=SUPPRESS` skips, `RESEND` re-sends, `DesiredDeliveryMediums=["SMS"]` excludes email, and template placeholders (`{username}`, `{####}`) expand. Sender resolves to `EmailConfiguration.From`, falling back to `no-reply@verificationemail.com` (overridable via `COGNITO_DEFAULT_FROM`); set `COGNITO_EMAIL_ENABLED=false` to short-circuit globally. Adds the previously-missing `ResendConfirmationCode` action while wiring the delivery path. Contributed by @kjdev.
- **Step Functions JSONata `Assign` + workflow variables** — state-level `Assign` fields now bind values into an execution-scoped variable store, and later JSONata expressions can reference them as `$name` (with dotted-path access like `$user.email`). Pass `$states.result` resolves to the computed Output; Task `$states.result` to the raw API result; Catch handlers expose `$states.errorOutput`. Undefined references surface as `States.QueryEvaluationError`, matching the AWS error code for JSONata evaluation failures. Reported by @youngkwangk.

### Fixed
- **Cognito alias-attribute user lookup** — `_resolve_user` now honors the pool's `AliasAttributes` and `UsernameAttributes`, so signing in by `email` / `phone_number` / `preferred_username` resolves correctly. Email and phone aliases require the corresponding `_verified` attribute to equal `"true"` (matches AWS); `preferred_username` has no verification gate. The change routes `AdminInitiateAuth`, `InitiateAuth`, `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`, `RespondToAuthChallenge`, `ConfirmSignUp`, `ForgotPassword`, `ConfirmForgotPassword`, and the hosted-UI `/login` form through the resolver — internal call sites that need the canonical username (group iteration, create-time uniqueness, post-code token issuance) are left untouched. Contributed by @rjmackay.
- **SQS `ReceiveMessage` `InternalError` on FIFO queues with `RedrivePolicy`** — a double-JSON-encoded `RedrivePolicy` value slipped past `CreateQueue` / `SetQueueAttributes`, then crashed `_dlq_sweep` on receive because `json.loads` returned a string (not a dict) and `.get()` raised `AttributeError`. MiniStack now validates `RedrivePolicy` at intake (parseable JSON object with non-empty `deadLetterTargetArn` and numeric `maxReceiveCount` between 1 and 1000) and rejects malformed values with `InvalidAttributeValue` (400), matching real AWS. Receive carries a defensive guard so legacy persisted state doesn't crash. Reported by @rbonestell.
- **DynamoDB `if_not_exists` arithmetic in `SET` expressions** — `SET v = (if_not_exists(v, :d) - :amt)` previously dropped the arithmetic and assigned the resolved value directly: the outer parens kept every token at depth > 0, so the top-level operator scan never saw the `-` at depth 0. `_eval_set_value` now strips a single layer of matched outer parens before parsing, guarded so `(a) + (b)` (two adjacent groups) isn't accidentally flattened. Reported by @youngkwangk.
- **S3 → Lambda notifications fire for non-boto3 SDK clients** — MiniStack's notification XML parser only recognised the legacy `<CloudFunction>` ARN tag, which is what botocore wire-serialises `LambdaFunctionArn` as. AWS SDK for Java v2, Go SDK, Terraform's `aws_s3_bucket_notification`, and any hand-crafted XML send the modern `<LambdaFunctionArn>` tag — MiniStack silently dropped those configs, so uploads succeeded but the Lambda never fired. Both shapes are now accepted, matching real S3. Reported by @michael-denyer.

---

## [1.3.39] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Node.js Lambda — `@aws-sdk/client-*` built-in stubs** — real Node.js 18+ Lambda ships the AWS SDK v3 built-in; MiniStack's worker now intercepts `require('@aws-sdk/client-*')` and returns lightweight stubs that route through `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` when the real package isn't installed (Lambda Layers still win). `@aws-sdk/client-lambda` gets a REST stub; 28 `awsJson1.x` services resolve via a generic `X-Amz-Target` Proxy. `err.name`/`err.code` set per v3 catch-by-name convention. HTTPS→HTTP localhost downgrade extended to CDK Provider Framework's `cfn-response.js` PUT. Query-protocol / REST-XML / REST-path clients still need bundling or a Layer, as on real AWS outside a managed runtime. Contributed by @hiddengearz.

### Fixed
- **Cognito OIDC federation callback (`/oauth2/idpresponse`)** — OIDC federation was half-wired: `/oauth2/authorize` redirected to the IdP correctly but routed the callback at `/saml2/idpresponse`, which only accepts SAML, so every IdP `code`+`state` callback 400'd. MiniStack now serves `/oauth2/idpresponse`: exchanges the code at the IdP's `token_url`, decodes the `id_token` (no signature verification — same posture as SAML), applies `AttributeMapping`, provisions the `{provider}_{sub}` user, and 302s back to the app with a MiniStack-issued code. Reported by @ocr-lasagna.
- **Step Functions executions stalling at `ExecutionStarted` under non-default account IDs** — `_executions` is an `AccountScopedDict` keyed by `get_account_id()` (a `ContextVar`); the background worker was spawned via plain `threading.Thread` which doesn't propagate contextvars, so the worker looked up the execution under the default account, found nothing, and silently returned. Fixed with `contextvars.copy_context().run` on each thread target, with per-thread snapshots at the Parallel and Map spawn sites (a single `Context` cannot be entered by two threads concurrently). Contributed by @michael-denyer.
- **Step Functions JSONata `Arguments` on `aws-sdk` Task states** — Tasks with `QueryLanguage: "JSONata"` now evaluate `Arguments` and success/Catch `Output` against `$states.input` / `$states.result` / `$states.errorOutput`, instead of dispatching with an empty JSONPath payload. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **Step Functions JSONata coverage for Pass and Choice** — Pass now evaluates `Output` (previously silently ignored). Choice now evaluates per-branch `Condition` (previously always treated as falsy, falling through to `Default`) and applies per-branch `Output` on the matched rule. Evaluator extended with comparison/arithmetic/string-concat/and/or/in/not, `$count`/`$length`/`$string`/`$number`, paren grouping, unary minus, left-associative parsing. Reported by @youngkwangk.

---

## [1.3.38] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **ECS task IAM role credentials endpoint (`GET /v2/credentials/<uuid>`)** — real ECS injects `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI=/v2/credentials/<uuid>` per task and SDKs fetch credentials by GETting that path against `169.254.170.2`. MiniStack now serves the same path on the gateway and returns the AWS-strict 5-field credentials document (`AccessKeyId`, `SecretAccessKey`, `Token`, `Expiration`, `RoleArn`) — distinct from the IMDS shape served at `/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<role>`. Contributed by @YakirOren.
- **ECS task env injection for SDK-driven workloads** — tasks launched by MiniStack's ECS emulator now also get `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI` (so SDKs in task containers fetch emulated credentials automatically from the new `/v2/credentials/<uuid>` endpoint), `AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` (satisfies botocore's allow-list when the gateway host is not loopback, e.g. `host.docker.internal` or a Docker bridge IP), and `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` (so SDK service calls auto-route to the gateway). Together with the existing `ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4`, unmodified AWS SDKs running inside an emulated ECS task now use MiniStack end-to-end with no client config. Contributed by @YakirOren.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::CertificateManager::Certificate`** — provisions a Certificate record matching `RequestCertificate` shape. `Ref` resolves to the ARN; honours `DomainName`, `SubjectAlternativeNames`, `ValidationMethod`, `Tags`, `KeyAlgorithm`, `CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference`. Closes a gap that blocked any HTTPS-related IaC stack from applying against MiniStack. Reported by @parv0888.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup`** — MS' ALB CFN story was previously partial: `LoadBalancer` and `Listener` provisioned but `TargetGroup` was missing, leaving the listener with nothing to forward to. The new handler writes a target-group record matching `CreateTargetGroup`, with AWS-documented defaults (HTTP, port 80, health-check interval 30, healthy/unhealthy thresholds 5/2, matcher 200). `Tags` and `TargetGroupAttributes` honoured. Reported by @parv0888.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::ListenerRule`** — host- and path-based ALB routing now provisions. Conditions accept both the flat `{Field, Values}` shape and CFN's per-field nested config form (`PathPatternConfig.Values`, `HostHeaderConfig.Values`, `HttpHeaderConfig`, `HttpRequestMethodConfig`, `QueryStringConfig`, `SourceIpConfig`). Actions support `forward` / `redirect` / `fixed-response`. Reported by @parv0888.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`** — standalone DB instances (non-Aurora) and Aurora cluster members now provision. Writes a record matching `CreateDBInstance` (metadata-only, like the existing `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` handler — Docker container spawn remains on the CLI/SDK path). Aurora cluster members inherit master credentials from the cluster automatically. `Fn::GetAtt` returns `Endpoint.Address`, `Endpoint.Port`, `DbiResourceId`, `DBInstanceArn`. Reported by @parv0888.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine` `Definition` and `DefinitionS3Location`** — CDK's `DefinitionBody.fromFile()` emits `DefinitionS3Location` referencing an S3 asset, and `DefinitionBody.fromString()` emits the inline `Definition` object; MiniStack previously honoured only `DefinitionString` and silently fell back to `{}`, producing `InvalidDefinition: StartAt state 'None' not found` at execution time. Both forms are now honoured, `DefinitionS3Location` is fetched from the in-memory S3 service, and `DefinitionSubstitutions` placeholders (`${KEY}`) are applied to the resolved definition. Reported by @youngkwangk.

### Fixed
- **ECS `connectivityAt` and `stoppingAt` timestamps wire-formatted as numbers** — both fields are set on tasks but were missing from the `_ECS_TIMESTAMP_FIELDS` normalization set, so they shipped as ISO strings in `DescribeTasks` / `ListTasks` responses. The Go AWS SDK v2 (strict JSON 1.1 timestamp parsing) rejected the response; boto3 was lenient and hid the issue. Both fields are now epoch-normalized alongside the other task timestamps. Contributed by @YakirOren.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition` populates `registeredAt`, `registeredBy`, and `compatibilities`** — the CFN provisioner constructed the task-definition record without these three fields, so `DescribeTaskDefinition` returned them as missing for CFN-created TDs even though the CLI/SDK path (`RegisterTaskDefinition`) always set them. Workloads that read `registeredAt` (e.g. the ARMO ECS operator and other reconcilers) had to fall back to "now". The CFN path now mirrors the CLI path. Contributed by @YakirOren.

---

## [1.3.37] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- **CloudFormation `AWS::ApiGateway::Authorizer`** — stacks declaring a TOKEN / REQUEST / COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizer now provision against the existing apigateway_v1 store instead of failing the stack with `Unsupported resource type`. Maps the standard CFN properties (`Name`, `Type`, `AuthorizerUri`, `AuthorizerCredentials`, `IdentitySource`, `IdentityValidationExpression`, `AuthorizerResultTtlInSeconds`, `ProviderARNs`, `RestApiId`); `AuthType` is informational only in the AWS spec and is dropped.
- **SQS `AddPermission` / `RemovePermission`** — both operations now wire through to the queue's IAM resource policy stored under the existing `Policy` queue attribute. `AddPermission` appends statements in AWS canonical shape (bare 12-digit account IDs in `Principal.AWS`, lowercase `sqs:` action namespace, `<queue-arn>/SQSDefaultPolicy` Id). Duplicate `Label` is rejected with `InvalidParameterValue`; `RemovePermission` is idempotent per AWS.
- **RDS `DescribePendingMaintenanceActions` no-op surface** — accepts the operation and returns an empty `PendingMaintenanceActions` list. Accepts and ignores `ResourceIdentifier`, `Filters`, `Marker`, and `MaxRecords`. Unblocks brownfield state-capture tooling that walks the full RDS API surface. Contributed by @jayjanssen.

### Fixed
- **SQS `SendMessage` honors `MaximumMessageSize`** — body byte length is now validated against the queue's `MaximumMessageSize` attribute (default 262144, configurable up to 1 MiB per AWS). Oversized messages return `InvalidParameterValue` (400). Before this fix MS silently accepted oversized messages that real AWS would reject.
- **SNS `Publish` and `PublishBatch` enforce 256 KiB** — total payload size (Message + MessageAttributes name/type/value bytes) is now bounded at 262144 bytes per AWS docs. `Publish` returns `InvalidParameter` (400); `PublishBatch` surfaces each oversized entry as a per-entry failure rather than failing the whole batch. Subject is intentionally excluded (AWS limits Subject to 100 chars but does not count it toward the 256 KB payload).
- **EventBridge SQS target stamps `SqsParameters.MessageGroupId` on FIFO queues** — `_dispatch_to_sqs` now reads the target's `SqsParameters` block and stamps `MessageGroupId` on the delivered message; it also derives a content-based `MessageDeduplicationId` and a `fifo_seq` so the delivery shape matches real EventBridge → FIFO SQS. Before this fix MS dropped MessageGroupId at dispatch, so FIFO targets received messages real AWS would reject.
- **SQS `DeleteQueue` raises `QueueDoesNotExist` for missing queues** — the action silently returned `{}` when the URL didn't match a stored queue. Real AWS returns 400 `QueueDoesNotExist` (awsQueryCompatible `AWS.SimpleQueueService.NonExistentQueue`). The handler now routes through the same `_get_q` helper every other SQS action uses, also picking up its docker-compose-hostname fallback. Contributed by @mfurqaan31.
- **S3 `UploadPartCopy` validates `x-amz-copy-source-range`** — the header was parsed with `rng.split("-")` and no validation, so malformed values (`bytes=abc-def`, extra dashes, missing prefix) raised an unhandled `ValueError` and surfaced as HTTP 500; reversed and out-of-bounds ranges silently produced wrong-sized parts. All malformed inputs now return 400 `InvalidArgument`; out-of-bounds includes the source object size in the error message. boto3 retries 5xx but fails fast on 4xx, so the prior 500 behaviour caused infinite client retry loops against MiniStack where real S3 would have failed immediately. Contributed by @mfurqaan31.
- **S3 `_parse_bucket_key` strips absolute-form request targets** — AWS SDK for .NET v4 sends HTTP/1.1 requests with absolute-form targets (e.g. `PUT http://ministack:4566/bucket/key`); hypercorn passes the raw target through, so MS was parsing `http:` as the bucket name. The function now strips scheme + authority before parsing. Contributed by @mark-bray.

---

## [1.3.36] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **IAM AWS-managed policies (`arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/<Name>`)** — real AWS hosts these under a virtual `aws` account every customer can read; MiniStack used to key every policy by the caller's account so `GetPolicy(arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess)` returned `NoSuchEntity`. AWS-managed policies now live in a separate non-account-scoped store, pre-seeded with 20 of the most commonly referenced policies (`AdministratorAccess`, `PowerUserAccess`, `ReadOnlyAccess`, `SecurityAudit`, `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`, `AmazonS3FullAccess`/`ReadOnlyAccess`, `AmazonEC2FullAccess`/`ReadOnlyAccess`, `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`, `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`, `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole`, and friends) carrying their canonical AWS documents verbatim. Unknown AWS-managed ARNs return `NoSuchEntity` by default so typos surface locally; opt in to permissive autovivify with `MINISTACK_AUTOCREATE_AWS_MANAGED=1`. `AttachmentCount` is tracked per-(session-account, arn) via an account-scoped sidecar, matching real AWS where the counter is per-account. `ListPolicies` respects `Scope=All`/`AWS`/`Local`; attach/detach work against any AWS-managed ARN; mutation operations (`CreatePolicy` into the `aws` namespace, `DeletePolicy`, `TagPolicy`, `UntagPolicy`, `CreatePolicyVersion`, `DeletePolicyVersion`) return `AccessDenied` / `InvalidInput` to match real AWS. Contributed by @spicykay.
- **Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)** — full 7-operation surface (`PutReportDefinition`, `DescribeReportDefinitions`, `ModifyReportDefinition`, `DeleteReportDefinition`, `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, `ListTagsForResource`). Report definitions persist; report file generation is not emulated (MiniStack doesn't track usage or compute costs), so this targets IaC validation — Terraform / CDK / Bash automation that manages `aws_cur_report_definition` resources can now plan and apply against MiniStack without hitting real AWS billing. Contributed by @staranto.
- **Lambda Ruby 4.0 runtime** — `ruby4.0` maps to `public.ecr.aws/lambda/ruby:4.0`, tracking the runtime AWS added in May 2026 (botocore 1.42.94).

### Fixed
- **RDS `DescribeDBClusters` serialization — `DatabaseName`, `NetworkType`, `EngineLifecycleSupport`** — three independent shape bugs on the same code path. `DatabaseName` was stored as `""` and always emitted, so botocore parsed it as the empty string instead of `null`; the field is now stored as `None` when unset and only emitted when truthy, matching real-AWS XML elision. `NetworkType` and `EngineLifecycleSupport` were never stored or serialized; they're now accepted from the request and emit with the AWS-documented defaults (`IPV4` and `open-source-rds-extended-support`). Surfaced by brownfield-import diffing against a real-AWS captured Aurora cluster. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **RDS `DescribeDBClusterParameters` emits `<Source>` element** — the cluster-parameter response XML omitted `<Source>` entirely, so botocore materialized `Parameters[].Source` as `None` for every entry. Each emitted `<Parameter>` now includes `<Source>user</Source>`, matching the existing instance-level path. Note: MiniStack only stores user-modified parameters (engine defaults are not modelled); the literal `user` is correct for the slice MS currently returns but will need to become conditional once engine-defaults are added. Surfaced by the same brownfield-import diffing. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **CUR report definitions lost on warm-boot** — the CUR module declared `get_state()` and `restore_state()` but the `load_state("cur")` call at import time was missing, so MiniStack wrote state on shutdown and never read it on restart. Standard import-time block added; `PERSIST_STATE=1` now correctly survives across container restarts for CUR.
- **IAM `AttachmentCount` on AWS-managed policies reset on warm-boot** — the per-(session-account, arn) sidecar `_aws_managed_attachment_counts` added with the AWS-managed-policies work was missing from `get_state` / `restore_state`. Customer-managed `AttachmentCount` already persisted via the policy record itself; only the AWS-managed-policy sidecar was dropped. Now wired in.

## [1.3.35] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **EKS `CreateCluster` — k3s container now starts with `privileged=True`** — the k3s server container was being launched with a granular `cap_add` list + unconfined seccomp/apparmor in an attempt to avoid privileged mode, but k3s server mode remounts `/sys/fs/cgroup` and no capability set short of `--privileged` permits that. The container exited on boot with `failed to evacuate root cgroup: mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/init: read-only file system`, breaking EKS cluster creation entirely. The container is now launched with `privileged=True`; the cap_add list is retained as defence-in-depth. Documented as a host-security trade-off in the EKS section of the README. Reported by @zkoncir.
- **SNS FIFO topic → standard SQS queue subscription** — MiniStack rejected the subscribe with `InvalidParameterException: Topic with FIFO requires a subscription to a FIFO SQS Queue`, which was the AWS rule until 2023-09-14 when AWS added support for FIFO topics fanning out to standard SQS queues. The stale validation is removed; the existing fanout path already attaches `MessageGroupId` / `MessageDeduplicationId` to delivered messages and SQS standard queues ignore those fields, matching real AWS where consumers of a standard queue subscribed to a FIFO topic "may receive messages out of order, and more than once." Contributed by @ellouzeskandercs.
- **RDS `CreateDBInstance` honors `PreferredMaintenanceWindow`** — the field was hardcoded to `sun:05:00-sun:06:00` on the instance record at creation time, silently discarding any caller-supplied value. `ModifyDBInstance` and cluster-level `PreferredMaintenanceWindow` already worked, so the divergence was per-instance only on create. The create path now reads the user value and falls back to the default only when none is supplied. Surfaced by Terraform `aws_rds_cluster_instance.preferred_maintenance_window` round-trip diffing against a real-AWS capture. Contributed by @jayjanssen.

## [1.3.34] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **ECR Docker Registry HTTP API V2 (`docker push` / `docker pull`)** — the registry V2 wire protocol now serves alongside the AWS API on the same gateway, matching real ECR. Covers `/v2/` ping, `/v2/_catalog`, chunked and single-shot blob upload, cross-repo blob mount, blob HEAD/GET/DELETE, manifest PUT/GET/HEAD/DELETE (by tag or digest), and `/tags/list`. Pushed images surface immediately in `aws ecr describe-images`; layer and manifest bytes persist under `PERSIST_STATE=1`. Routing fix bundled: registry paths previously fell through to S3 path-style and returned `405`; the new pre-empt matches only registry shapes (`/blobs/`, `/manifests/`, `/tags/list`) so API Gateway v2, AppSync Events, and SES v2 are unaffected. Reported by @LeTrungNguyen1703.
- **CloudFormation Custom Resource protocol** — `Custom::*` and `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` now run the full Create / Update / Delete lifecycle. MiniStack mints a local `/_ministack/cfn-response/{token}` intercept in place of a pre-signed S3 ResponseURL, and the provisioner runs in `asyncio.to_thread` so the loop stays free for the Lambda's PUT callback — required for CDK `cr.Provider`-backed Lambdas. `Update` forwards `OldResourceProperties`; `Delete` carries the `PhysicalResourceId` from `Create`; `PhysicalResourceId` falls back to `RequestId` when the Lambda omits it. `ServiceToken` accepts bare function names or full Lambda ARNs. Contributed by @hiddengearz.

### Fixed
- **Cognito OAuth2 `nonce` echoed into `id_token`** — the authorize endpoint already stored the client-supplied `nonce` on the auth code, but `/oauth2/token` never threaded it into the minted id_token. Per OIDC Core 1.0 §3.1.3.7, strict OIDC libraries (`oidc-client-ts`, `react-oidc-context`, Auth0 / Microsoft clients) discard tokens missing an expected nonce. Now stamped on the id_token only; access and refresh tokens unchanged. Contributed by @coezbek.

---

## [1.3.33] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **CloudFormation `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable`** — covers the schema CDK `TableV2` emits. Honors `KeySchema`, `AttributeDefinitions`, `BillingMode`, `StreamSpecification`, `GlobalSecondaryIndexes`, `LocalSecondaryIndexes`, `SSESpecification`, `TimeToLiveSpecification`, and `TableName`. For PROVISIONED billing, `WriteProvisionedThroughputSettings.WriteCapacityAutoScalingSettings.MinCapacity` and `ReadProvisionedThroughputSettings.ReadCapacityAutoScalingSettings.MinCapacity` are translated to the engine's static `ProvisionedThroughput.{Write,Read}CapacityUnits` (since a single-process emulator doesn't simulate auto-scaling). `Replicas` is accepted and ignored — cross-region replication has no meaning here — along with `MultiRegionConsistency`, `GlobalTableWitnesses`, `GlobalTableSourceArn`, `WarmThroughput`, `ReadOnDemandThroughputSettings`, and `WriteOnDemandThroughputSettings`. Stacks that mix `AWS::DynamoDB::Table` and `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` deploy unmodified. Reported by @youngkwangk.

---

## [1.3.32] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **EC2 VPN Connection support** — `CreateVpnConnection`, `DescribeVpnConnections`, `DeleteVpnConnection`, `CreateVpnConnectionRoute`, `DeleteVpnConnectionRoute`. Stores `Type`, `CustomerGatewayId`, `VpnGatewayId`, `TransitGatewayId`, `Options.StaticRoutesOnly`, and per-connection `Routes`. Contributed by @tmq107.

### Fixed
- **Cognito OIDC autodiscovery** — `/.well-known/openid-configuration` now returns reachable endpoint URLs at the MiniStack gateway instead of unreachable `cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com` URLs that don't serve OAuth2 anywhere. `response_types_supported` now advertises both `code` and `token`, matching real AWS Cognito. Amplify and other OIDC clients can now auto-configure against MiniStack without manual endpoint setup. Reported by @coezbek.
- **Cognito OAuth2 / OIDC endpoints send CORS** — `/oauth2/authorize`, `/oauth2/token`, `/oauth2/userInfo`, `/logout`, and `/.well-known/*` were returning raw response tuples that bypassed `_with_data_plane_headers`, so browser-based OIDC clients (Amplify, `oidc-client-ts`, `react-oidc-context`) failed cross-origin discovery and token exchange with `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`. The dispatchers are now routed through the same wildcard-CORS wrapper every other data-plane response uses. Contributed by @coezbek.
- **EC2 `RunInstances` honors `PrivateIpAddress` and `IamInstanceProfile`** — `--private-ip-address` was ignored and the auto-generated default IP was malformed (`10.0193.216` from a missing dot separator in `_random_ip`). `--iam-instance-profile` was dropped entirely, so the launched instance had no `IamInstanceProfile` field in `RunInstances` or `DescribeInstances`. Both parameters are now stored on the instance record and emitted in the XML response (`<iamInstanceProfile><arn/><id/></iamInstanceProfile>`). Reported by @coseym.
- **EC2 `DescribeRouteTables` emits `propagatingVgwSet`** — `EnableVgwRoutePropagation` stored the gateway ID on the route table but `DescribeRouteTables` always returned an empty `<propagatingVgwSet/>`, so any IaC tool that round-trips through Describe lost the propagation. Now serializes whatever `EnableVgwRoutePropagation` recorded. Contributed by @tmq107.
- **DynamoDB GSI Query pagination with non-unique sort keys** — when multiple items shared the same `(GSI_HASH, GSI_RANGE)` value (or for hash-only GSIs), `ExclusiveStartKey` either dropped items silently from page 2 onward or cycled the caller through the same items indefinitely. Real DynamoDB orders GSI results by `(INDEX_HASH, INDEX_SORT, BASE_PK, BASE_SK)`; MiniStack now uses the same hidden tiebreak so cursors advance correctly across pages. Common pattern with single-table designs / ElectroDB collections. Reported by @bensont1 and @mspiller.

---

## [1.3.31] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- **EC2 AWS-managed prefix lists** — `DescribePrefixLists`, `DescribeManagedPrefixLists`, and `GetManagedPrefixListEntries` now return deterministic CIDRs (instead of `0.0.0.0/0`) for the standard AWS-managed prefix list names: `s3`, `dynamodb`, `s3express`, `vpc-lattice`, `route53-healthchecks`, `ec2-instance-connect`, `cloudfront`, `groundstation`. IPv4 entries use the CGNAT range (`100.64.0.0/10`), IPv6 uses `64:ff9b:1::/48`. IDs and entries are stable across calls so VPC endpoint provisioning of type `Gateway` resolves consistently. Contributed by @jgrumboe.

### Fixed
- **Lambda multi-account isolation** — function workers spawned under non-default accounts now receive `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` derived from the function ARN instead of the host process env var, so `STS GetCallerIdentity` and internal SDK calls inside the handler resolve to the correct account. The warm-worker pool key is now `{account}:{function}:{qualifier}`, preventing two accounts that deploy the same function name from sharing a worker. Fixes all four execution paths (warm worker, provided runtime, local subprocess, Docker container). Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **S3 `GetObject` by `VersionId` `Last-Modified` header** — the versioned `GetObject` path emitted the internal ISO-8601 timestamp directly into the HTTP `Last-Modified` header, where AWS returns RFC 7231 HTTP-date. AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 strictly parses the header and threw after the 200 response. Now wrapped through `iso_to_rfc7231`, matching the non-versioned path. Contributed by @mgius-ae.
- **EC2 `RunInstances` and `DescribeInstances` emit `BlockDeviceMappings`** — every launched instance now auto-attaches a root EBS volume (`/dev/xvda`, gp3, 8 GiB, `DeleteOnTermination: true`) registered with `_volumes` and surfaced through both `DescribeInstances` (with `<volumeId>`, `<status>`, `<attachTime>`, `<deleteOnTermination>`) and `DescribeVolumes` (with the matching `Attachments` link), matching real AWS where every EBS-backed AMI auto-attaches a root volume regardless of whether the launch request specified `BlockDeviceMappings`. Cloud Custodian, AWS Config rules, and any policy tool that classifies instances by BDM presence now work. Reported by @Aeres-u99.

---

## [1.3.30] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Step Functions REST-JSON `aws-sdk` response casing** — successful REST-JSON integrations such as `aws-sdk:rdsdata:executeStatement` now expose output keys with the same PascalCase convention used by the query and REST-XML dispatchers (`Records`, `NumberOfRecordsUpdated`) instead of raw wire camelCase, so `ResultSelector` paths like `$.Records` resolve correctly. Contributed by @jayjanssen.

---

## [1.3.29] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- **EC2 `DescribeVpcEndpointServices`** — returns the standard catalog of 2 Gateway services (`s3`, `dynamodb`) and 17 Interface PrivateLink services with region-templated DNS names and stable per-service IDs. `ServiceNames`, `service-name`, and `service-type` filters supported. Reported by @svenikea.
- **DynamoDB legacy `AttributeUpdates`** — `UpdateItem` now applies the pre-expression parameter with `PUT` (default), `DELETE` (full removal or set subtract), and `ADD` (numeric increment or set union) actions. Mutually exclusive with `UpdateExpression`. .NET AWS SDK upserts (`UpdateItem` under the hood) were silently dropping all non-key fields. Reported by @gnjack.

### Fixed
- **Step Functions `aws-sdk:ec2` security group compatibility** — `CreateSecurityGroup` now maps SDK `Description` to wire `GroupDescription`, `DescribeSecurityGroups` sends EC2-shaped filters (`Filter.1.Value.1` instead of `member.N`), and the XML adapter returns `SecurityGroups` rather than raw `SecurityGroupInfo`. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **Step Functions `aws-sdk:s3` integration** — S3 was tagged as `rest`-protocol with no dispatcher; every call failed with `States.Runtime`. New REST-XML dispatcher covers `ListBuckets`, `CreateBucket`, `DeleteBucket`, `HeadBucket`, `GetBucketVersioning`, `ListObjectsV2`, `ListObjects`, `HeadObject`, `CopyObject`, `DeleteObject`, `GetObjectTagging`, `PutObjectTagging`. `GetObject`/`PutObject` deferred to Phase 2. Reported by @LeTrungNguyen1703.
- **SQS `ReceiveMessage` honors `MessageSystemAttributeNames`** — only the deprecated `AttributeNames` was read, so AWS SDK v2 (Java/Kotlin) consumers got empty `Attributes` and broken `ApproximateReceiveCount`-based redelivery detection. Contributed by @joaomena.
- **CFN `AWS::SNS::Subscription` honors `RawMessageDelivery`** — the provisioner silently defaulted to `false` even when templates set `true`, so consumers got SNS-wrapped envelopes instead of raw payloads. Contributed by @joaomena.

---

## [1.3.28] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- **ECS Task Metadata V4** — every container started by `RunTask` now gets `ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4` injected, and the gateway serves `/v4/<token>`, `/v4/<token>/task` (with sibling `Containers` array), and `/v4/<token>/stats` + `/task/stats` (stub). Standard `com.amazonaws.ecs.*` container labels. `RunTask` also translates `privileged`, `linuxParameters.capabilities.add`, `pidMode: host`, and `volumes` + `mountPoints` into Docker bind mounts. Contributed by @YakirOren.

### Fixed
- **DynamoDB legacy `Expected` (PutItem / UpdateItem / DeleteItem) and `KeyConditions` (Query)** — previously ignored; SDKs and code paths that still use the pre-expression API now work. `ScanFilter` / `QueryFilter` comparison support extended to all 13 legacy operators (`EQ`, `NE`, `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT`, `NOT_NULL`, `NULL`, `CONTAINS`, `NOT_CONTAINS`, `BEGINS_WITH`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`) with type-aware numeric comparison. Reported by @darkamgine
- **DynamoDB `TransactWriteItems` multi-failure reporting** — only the first failing item was marked in `CancellationReasons`; AWS returns a `ConditionalCheckFailed` entry for every failing item in the transaction. Now evaluates all conditions in a first pass and reports each failure. Reported by @anghel93 and @gnjack


---

## [1.3.27] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **AWS CloudTrail** — in-memory audit log + control plane. Recording opt-in via `CLOUDTRAIL_RECORDING=1`; per-account ring buffer (`CLOUDTRAIL_MAX_EVENTS=10000`). `LookupEvents` supports all 8 AWS `LookupAttributes`. Control plane: `CreateTrail`, `DeleteTrail`, `GetTrail`, `DescribeTrails`, `ListTrails`, `UpdateTrail`, `GetTrailStatus`, `StartLogging` / `StopLogging` with real `IsLogging` state, `Put`/`GetEventSelectors`, `AddTags` / `ListTags` / `RemoveTags`. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil.
- **AWS Resource Groups (`resource-groups`, 2017-11-27)** — 19 of 23 spec operations: group CRUD, resource queries, configuration, membership, tagging, account settings. Tag-sync ops omitted (not exposed by AWS CLI / Terraform). Requested by @staranto.

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v1 `GetUsagePlanKey`** — `GET /usageplans/{planId}/keys/{keyId}` handler was missing; per-key path fell through to 404. Terraform's `GetUsagePlanKey` refresh after `CreateUsagePlanKey` aborted every `aws_api_gateway_usage_plan_key` apply. Contributed by @marcin-nowak-scl.
- **API Gateway v1 HTTP_PROXY path-param substitution + query-string forwarding** — `{paramName}` placeholders in integration `uri` were forwarded literally; the inbound execute path was appended to the integration URI; query string was dropped. Now substitutes from `integration.request.path.X = method.request.path.X` mappings (plus `{proxy}` for `{proxy+}`), uses the substituted URI as the upstream URL, and forwards the query string. Contributed by @marcin-nowak-scl.
- **API Gateway v1 `UpdateModel`** — `PATCH /restapis/{id}/models/{name}` was missing; Terraform `aws_api_gateway_model` updates 404
- **Transfer Family `LOGICAL` root home directory mappings** — `Entry="/"` failed to match because the resolver built `"//"` as the prefix. Contributed by @stefanmb.
- **CloudTrail router target prefix** — was `AmazonCloudTrailService`; AWS uses `CloudTrail_20131101`. Routing still worked via credential scope, but the prefix entry was dead code.
- **CloudTrail `IsLogging` state on `Stop`/`StartLogging`** — both were no-ops; `GetTrailStatus` always returned `IsLogging: True`. Now flips the trail record's state and stamps `_StartedAt` / `_StoppedAt` (int epoch).
- **STS `Credentials.Expiration` is int epoch in the JSON path** — `AssumeRole` / `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` / `GetSessionToken` returned a float; Java/Go SDK v2 reject it.
- **`backup` / `eks` `_epoch()` / `_now()` return int** — were `time.time()` (float); consumed by record fields like `createdAt`.
- **DynamoDB `ConditionalCheckFailedException` populates `Item` on `ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure="ALL_OLD"`** — `PutItem` / `UpdateItem` / `DeleteItem` / `TransactWriteItems` now return the prior item alongside the error code (and on the failing `CancellationReason` for transactions). Verified against botocore: `CancellationReason` and `ConditionalCheckFailedException` shapes both include `Item`. Reported by @darkamgine.
- **CFN `AWS::S3::Bucket` preserves physical id on update** — auto-named buckets got a new random name on every `UpdateStack`, breaking `{Ref}` after redeploy. Contributed by @erick-reis-gran.
- **CFN `AWS::Lambda::Function` returns real `CodeSize` / `CodeSha256`** — were hardcoded; now computed from the deployment-package bytes. Contributed by @erick-reis-gran.

---

## [1.3.26] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **CloudFormation `AWS::CloudFront::KeyValueStore`** — Create / Update (Comment in place) / Delete; exposes `Arn`, `Id`, `Status` via `Fn::GetAtt`. CFN engine now routes previously-provisioned resources through a per-type `update` handler when one is defined, falling back to idempotent `create` otherwise. CloudFront `CreateKeyValueStore` accepts the optional `ImportSource` (`SourceType` + `SourceARN`) and round-trips it on the record.

### Fixed
- **OpenSearch non-VPC domains omit empty `VPCOptions`** — `CreateDomain` / `DescribeDomain` previously returned `VPCOptions: {}` alongside `Endpoint`, causing Terraform AWS provider reads to classify the domain as VPC-backed and fail with `OpenSearch Domain in VPC expected to have null Endpoint value`. Non-VPC domains now omit `VPCOptions`; VPC-shaped domains return `Endpoints["vpc"]` instead of `Endpoint`. Contributed by @marcin-nowak-scl.
- **S3 Files routes and shapes match AWS `s3files-2025-05-05`** — `CreateFileSystem` is `PUT /file-systems` (not `POST`); request and response bodies use camelCase (`bucket`, `roleArn`, `fileSystemId`, `creationTime` int epoch); resource tagging moved to `/resource-tags/{resourceId}`; `PutSynchronizationConfiguration` enforces optimistic concurrency via `latestVersionNumber`; standard `ValidationException` / `ResourceNotFoundException` / `ConflictException` errors with `application/json` content type. Resolves the reported `Unknown S3 Files route: PUT /file-systems` failure from the AWS CLI / Terraform. Reported by @tmq107

---

## [1.3.25] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **AppSync Events API** — Event API management under `/v2/apis`, channel namespaces, API keys via `/v1/apis/{apiId}/apikeys`, HTTP publish on `{apiId}.appsync-api.*`, and realtime WebSocket on `{apiId}.appsync-realtime-api.*` (`aws-appsync-event-ws` subprotocol). Strict auth via `APPSYNC_EVENTS_ENFORCE_AUTH=1`. Contributed by @marcin-nowak-scl.
- **CloudFront KeyValueStore — management plane** — Create/Describe/List/Update/Delete with ETag concurrency; `KeyValueStoreAssociations` round-tripped through CloudFront Functions. Contributed by @DaviReisVieira.
- **CloudFront KeyValueStore — data plane** — separate `cloudfront-keyvaluestore` service covering Describe, ListKeys, GetKey, PutKey, DeleteKey, UpdateKeys with ETag concurrency. Requested by @shellscape. Contributed by @DaviReisVieira.
- **EventBridge `cron()` schedule auto-fire** — full AWS-spec parity. Zero-dep parser for the 6-field syntax: `*`, `?`, ranges, steps, lists, named month/weekday tokens, and the `L` (last day / `<n>L` last weekday-of-month), `LW` (last weekday), `<n>W` (nearest weekday), and `<n>#<k>` (kth weekday-of-month) operators. DoM/DoW mutual-exclusion enforced at `PutRule`. Contributed by @hiddengearz.

### Fixed
- **AppSync Events `ChannelNamespace` response now includes `channelNamespaceArn`** — spec member was omitted; Terraform / Java SDK v2 saw `null` where AWS returns the ARN.
- **CloudFront KVS data-plane `DescribeKeyValueStore` `Created` / `LastModified`** — were hardcoded to `0`; now parsed from the management-plane timestamp into int epoch seconds.
- **S3 vhost routing excludes `cloudfront-kvs.*`** — moved the bypass from a `/key-value-stores/` path check up to the `_NON_S3_VHOST_NAMES` host-name layer.
- **EventBridge `DescribeRule` / `ListRules` now emit `CreatedBy` and `ManagedBy`** — spec members were silently dropped from `_rule_out`.
- **EventBridge `PutEvents` rejects more than 10 entries** — AWS spec caps `Entries` at 10; ministack accepted any size.
- **EventBridge event `Time` is int epoch seconds, not float** — Java/Go SDK v2 timestamp parsers reject high-precision floats; archive replays now also dispatch the int form.
- **EventBridge content-filter `[{"exists": false}]` matches absent keys** — short-circuited to no-match before the `exists` branch was evaluated, so patterns that should fire on missing fields silently dropped.
- **EventBridge `ListRules` paginates** — added `Limit` (1-100) and opaque `NextToken`; previously returned the full list and SDK paginators looped on the first page.
- **EventBridge `ListRuleNamesByTarget` `NextToken` is opaque** — was a raw integer offset string.
- **EventBridge `DescribeEventBus` / `ListEventBuses` omit `Policy` when no policy set** — was emitting `""`, divergent from AWS shape.
- **EventBridge `DescribeEventSource` State** — was hardcoded `ENABLED`; AWS enum is `PENDING` / `ACTIVE` / `DELETED`. Now returns `ACTIVE`.

---

## [1.3.24] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed

- **`x-amzn-errortype` header now emitted on every JSON-protocol error response.** Real AWS sends the error type in both the body (`__type`) and the `x-amzn-errortype` header. boto3 falls back to the body, but Java SDK v2, Go SDK v2, and Rust SDK prefer the header — without it they surface `SdkClientException: unknown error type` instead of the actual code. Applied centrally in `error_response_json` and inline in 12 services that build error bodies directly (apigateway v1/v2, opensearch, scheduler, eks, ses, backup, sqs, cloudwatch, dynamodb, tagging).
- **AppConfig 404 bodies now include `__type`.** Was `{"Code": ..., "Message": ...}`; generic JSON error parsers that look for `__type` saw an unknown shape. Body now carries both styles.
- **Three previously-stateless services expose a no-op `reset()`** (`account`, `waf-classic`, `resourcegroupstaggingapi`) so `/_ministack/reset` no longer logs a warning per call.

---

## [1.3.23] — 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Amazon OpenSearch Service** — management plane on `/2021-01-01/*`: CreateDomain, DescribeDomain(s), DeleteDomain, ListDomainNames (with `EngineType` filter), UpdateDomainConfig, DescribeDomainConfig (`Options`/`Status` wrapping), DescribeDomainChangeProgress, ListVersions, GetCompatibleVersions, AddTags/ListTags/RemoveTags. Account-scoped state. Default data plane is a stub endpoint; set `OPENSEARCH_DATAPLANE=1` to spawn one real `opensearchproject/opensearch` container per `CreateDomain` (same pattern as ElastiCache/RDS). Add `OPENSEARCH_DASHBOARDS=1` for an optional per-domain `opensearch-dashboards` sidecar — `DescribeDomain.DashboardEndpoint` is populated. `DeleteDomain` tears down spawned containers. Terraform `aws_opensearch_domain` compatible. Requested by @marcin-nowak-scl.
- **EventBridge scheduled rule auto-fire** — `rate(N minute|hour|day)` rules now fire automatically. A daemon thread (`eb-scheduler`) ticks every 10 s; the per-rule countdown anchors to `CreationTime` so the first fire lands one full interval after `PutRule`. Scheduled event payload matches AWS exactly (`source: aws.events`, `detail-type: Scheduled Event`, `detail: {}`, ISO 8601 `time`). Multi-tenant — iterates the rules store directly. `cron()` expressions are stored but not yet auto-fired (one-time `INFO` log surfaces the gap). Contributed by @hiddengearz.
- **AWS Organizations** — DescribeOrganization, ListRoots, ListAccounts, DescribeAccount, ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent / ListAccountsForParent, CreateOrganizationalUnit / DescribeOrganizationalUnit / DeleteOrganizationalUnit. Single-master-account org auto-initialised on first call; nested OUs carry the new `Path` field (2026-03 AWS additive change).
- **AWS Account service** — GetAccountInformation, GetContactInformation, ListRegions, GetRegionOptStatus. Returns the new `AccountState: ACTIVE` field (2026-04 AWS additive change). Older boto3 SDKs strip the field; newer ones see it.
- **AWS Batch** — control-plane stub: ComputeEnvironments, JobQueues, JobDefinitions (auto-revisioning), SubmitJob (auto-`SUCCEEDED`), DescribeJobs, ListJobs. Account-scoped.
- **WAF Classic + Regional (v1)** — minimal stub so legacy clients (Terraform, old CFN) get clean empty-state responses instead of 405. `List*` returns empty arrays, `GetChangeToken`/`GetChangeTokenStatus` return valid responses, `Get*` for unknown resources returns `WAFNonexistentItemException`. For full WebACL state use `wafv2`.
- **EC2 DescribeRegions** — returns 31 commercial regions with correct `OptInStatus` (`opt-in-not-required` for legacy us-*/eu-*/ap-* regions, `opted-in` for newer ones). Supports `RegionNames` filter and `AllRegions` toggle.
- **Lambda `FileSystemConfigs` accepts S3 ARNs** — the 2026-04 AWS S3-mount addition. Server stores and round-trips whatever ARN format the SDK sends (EFS access points, S3 buckets, future shapes).
- **EventBridge `LogConfig`** — additive 2026-03 field on `CreateEventBus` / `UpdateEventBus`; persisted, returned on `DescribeEventBus`.
- **API Gateway v1 `securityPolicy` accepts the new TLS-1.3 enum** — allow-lists `SecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-FIPS-PFS-PQ-2025-09` (2026-03 addition) and any future opaque values; default remains `TLS_1_2`.

### Fixed

- **S3 `PostObject` accepts unquoted `Content-Disposition` field names** — .NET's `MultipartFormDataContent` emits `name=foo` for ASCII-clean values per RFC 2183; the parser previously only matched the quoted form `name="foo"` and dropped `key`/`success_action_status`, causing browser-form uploads from .NET clients to 400. Reported by @mattburton.
- **EventBridge target dispatch `time` field is ISO 8601** — was a Unix epoch float, AWS specifies a string like `2026-05-01T18:08:16Z`. Both `PutEvents`-driven and scheduled-rule-driven dispatches now use the canonical format.

### Performance

- **Idle RAM%** — Dockerfile now sets `PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2` and `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`. Verified zero correctness impact (no `assert` or `__doc__` introspection in ministack source); throughput unchanged.

## [1.3.22] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Cognito PreTokenGeneration Lambda trigger** — `LambdaConfig.PreTokenGenerationConfig` (V2_0) and the legacy `LambdaConfig.PreTokenGeneration` (V1_0) are now round-tripped through `CreateUserPool` / `UpdateUserPool` / `DescribeUserPool` and **invoked** at token-mint time. Before signing an access or id token, ministack synchronously invokes the configured Lambda with the AWS-shaped event (`triggerSource`, `userPoolId`, `request.userAttributes`, `request.groupConfiguration`, `request.scopes` for V2+, `callerContext.clientId`, etc.) and applies the Lambda's `response.claimsAndScopeOverrideDetails.{accessTokenGeneration,idTokenGeneration}` (V2_0: `claimsToAddOrOverride`, `claimsToSuppress`, `scopesToAdd`, `scopesToSuppress`, `groupOverrideDetails`) — or the legacy `response.claimsOverrideDetails` (V1_0, id token only). Refresh tokens are opaque in AWS and skip the trigger. Lambda errors fail open (token issued without overrides + warning logged); set `MINISTACK_COGNITO_PRETOKEN_STRICT=1` to fail closed the way real AWS does. Invocation reuses the existing `_resolve_name_and_qualifier` → `_get_func_record_for_qualifier` → `_execute_function` chain in `lambda_svc.py` — no new handlers added. Reported by @aahoughton (#533).
- **S3 PostObject (browser-based form upload)** — `POST /<bucket>/` with `multipart/form-data` is now handled. Honours `key` (with `${filename}` substitution from the file part), `Content-Type`, `x-amz-meta-*`, `x-amz-storage-class`, `x-amz-tagging`, the object-lock headers, `success_action_status` (200/201/204; default 204), and `success_action_redirect` (303 with `bucket=&key=&etag=` appended). On 201 returns the `<PostResponse>` XML with `Location`/`Bucket`/`Key`/`ETag`. Versioning, persistence, multi-tenancy, S3 event notifications all flow through the same path as `PutObject`. The `content-length-range` policy condition **is** enforced — uploads under the minimum return `EntityTooSmall` 400 and uploads over the maximum return `EntityTooLarge` 400 (matches AWS error codes). Other policy conditions and the signature field are accepted but not validated — same lenient stance as ministack's presigned-URL handling. boto3's `generate_presigned_post` works end-to-end. Requested by @mattburton (#535).
- **Init / ready scripts: expose `MINISTACK_INIT_SCRIPT_DIR` and `MINISTACK_INIT_SCRIPT_PATH` to each script** — every `.sh` / `.py` run from `/docker-entrypoint-initaws.d[/ready.d]` (or `/etc/localstack/init/{boot,ready}.d`) now sees its own directory and absolute path in the environment, so scripts can reference sibling files (`aws s3 cp "${MINISTACK_INIT_SCRIPT_DIR}/data.json" s3://bucket/`) without hardcoding the mount path or computing `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"`. Phase-level `MINISTACK_INIT_BOOT_DIR` / `MINISTACK_INIT_READY_DIR` are also set when those directories exist. Requested by @andreluiznsilva (#520).
- **EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) emulator** — new `imds` service responds on the gateway port at `/latest/api/token` (IMDSv2) and `/latest/meta-data/...` / `/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document`. Returns a credentials document under role `ministack-instance-role` so SDKs that fall through to the IMDS step of the default credential chain (boto3, aws-sdk-go-v2, AWS SDK Java v2) get a valid `ASIA*` session key + token. Both IMDSv1 (token-less) and IMDSv2 (PUT /token → GET with `X-aws-ec2-metadata-token`) supported; set `MINISTACK_IMDS_V2_REQUIRED=1` to reject token-less requests, matching AWS hop-limit-1 IMDSv2-only instances. Point SDKs at ministack via `AWS_EC2_METADATA_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566` (or `ec2_metadata_service_endpoint` in `~/.aws/config`); we don't bind the link-local 169.254.169.254 IP — that's a per-container network-alias concern, not portable from inside ministack. Reported by @bimargulies

### Fixed
- **S3 PutObject `StorageClass` was dropped on the floor** — objects written with `StorageClass=GLACIER` / `INTELLIGENT_TIERING` / etc. came back from `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, `ListObjects(V2)`, and `ListObjectVersions` as `STANDARD`. The header is now stored on the object record and emitted on the wire (header omitted for the default `STANDARD`, matching AWS). Same propagation through `CopyObject` (with optional override via `x-amz-storage-class`) and `CreateMultipartUpload` → `CompleteMultipartUpload`. Unknown storage class values now return `InvalidStorageClass` (400). Verified against `botocore/data/s3/2006-03-01/service-2.json`. Reported by @JoeHale (#534).

---


## [1.3.21] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **ElastiCache: real Redis replication groups + opt-in real Redis Cluster mode** — `CreateReplicationGroup` now spawns live Redis containers per shard (was a metadata-only stub). Behind `ELASTICACHE_CLUSTER_MODE_REAL=1` + `DOCKER_NETWORK`, `NumNodeGroups=N`/`ReplicasPerNodeGroup=R` provisions `N × (1+R)` cluster-enabled nodes, runs `redis-cli --cluster create`, and serves real `CLUSTER SLOTS` / `MOVED` redirects. `NumNodeGroups=2` rejected with `InvalidParameterValue` (matches AWS: only 1 or ≥3 shards). Account-scoped container names + `account_id` label so accounts can share `rg_id`; orphan-container reaper at startup. Reported by @akursar.

### Fixed
- **ElastiCache list responses wrapped items in `<member>` instead of the AWS-spec element name** — `DescribeCacheClusters` and 10 other list-emitting ops emitted `<member>` where AWS uses the model-declared `locationName` (e.g. `<CacheCluster>`, `<Tag>`, `<Snapshot>`). Strict generated SDKs (`aws-sdk-go-v2`, Java/Rust v2) parse a `<member>`-wrapped list as empty; botocore is permissive, so boto3 / CLI users never saw it. 16 sites fixed; the 5 remaining `<member>` sites (`UserList`, `UserGroupList`, `UserIdList`, etc.) match AWS. Verified against botocore service-2.json. Reported by @jmickey (#530).
- **RDS error codes carried a stale `Fault` suffix on two not-found shapes** — `DescribeDBInstances` (and 7 other DBInstance ops) emitted `<Code>DBInstanceNotFoundFault</Code>` while real AWS returns `<Code>DBInstanceNotFound</Code>`; `DescribeDBParameters` (and 9 other DBParameterGroup ops) emitted `<Code>DBParameterGroupNotFoundFault</Code>` while real AWS returns `<Code>DBParameterGroupNotFound</Code>`. Verified against `botocore/data/rds/2014-10-31/service-2.json` (the wire `error.code` differs from the shape name on ~19 RDS not-found errors — these two were the ones ministack emitted with the wrong wire code). Breaks string-matching consumers like the ACK RDS controller's `sdkFind`, which compares `awsErr.ErrorCode() == "DBInstanceNotFound"` to detect the not-found branch and reach the create path; with the `Fault` suffix the branch never matched and the CR sat at `Ready=False`. Also affects `aws-sdk-go-v2` (`smithy.APIError.ErrorCode()`) and any boto3 caller matching on `e.response["Error"]["Code"]`. Reported by @jmickey.
- **RDS error responses were missing `<Type>Sender</Type>` / `<Type>Receiver</Type>`** — real AWS Query-protocol error envelopes include the fault type alongside `<Code>` and `<Message>`. The `_error` helper now emits `Sender` for 4xx and `Receiver` for 5xx. Cosmetic for SDKs that read `<Code>` only, but completes the documented AWS shape.
- **API Gateway REST API (v1): pagination missing on 10 list operations** — `GetRestApis`, `GetResources`, `GetDeployments`, `GetAuthorizers`, `GetModels`, `GetApiKeys`, `GetUsagePlans`, `GetUsagePlanKeys`, `GetDomainNames`, and `GetBasePathMappings` ignored the AWS-spec `limit` (default 25, max 500) + `position` query params and always returned the full list with no `position` cursor. Pagination-aware SDKs that round-trip the cursor (boto3 paginators, AWS CLI `--max-items`/`--starting-token`, Java SDK v2) silently received the same first page on every call. The 10 ops now slice per `limit`, return an opaque base64url-encoded `position` token when more pages remain, and reject malformed tokens with `BadRequestException`. `GetStages` is correctly **not** paginated — its AWS shape has no `limit`/`position` fields.
- **API Gateway REST API (v1) `PutMethodResponse` and `PutIntegrationResponse` returned HTTP 200 instead of 201.** Real AWS returns 201 on resource creation (verified against `botocore/data/apigateway/2015-07-09/service-2.json`); the AWS CLI prints the resource on 201 and is silent on 200, so scripts that branched on stderr would diverge. The remaining v1 Create/Put ops already returned 201.

---

## [1.3.20] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **API Gateway (HTTP API and REST): JWT authorizer enforcement, HTTP proxy parameter mapping, and non-blocking proxy/JWKS I/O** — HTTP API (`apigateway`) and REST API (`apigateway_v1`) now enforce JWT `issuer` + `audience` validation against a JWKS URL (RS256 signatures only — Cognito's standard), apply request **parameter mappings** for `HTTP` / `HTTP_PROXY` integrations (`append`/`overwrite`/`remove` for headers and querystring, plus `overwrite:path`, with `$context.authorizer.jwt.claims.*` and `$stageVariables.*` substitution), and offload upstream proxy + JWKS fetches off the event loop so a slow backend can no longer stall unrelated requests. Authorizer issuers of the form `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{poolId}` are rewritten to MiniStack's local Cognito JWKS endpoint so locally-minted tokens verify without leaving the box. Reserved-header list for parameter mapping matches the AWS HTTP API spec exactly. Operator tuning: `MINISTACK_APIGW_PROXY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `30`), `MINISTACK_APIGW_JWKS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `5`). Cognito's signing key is now persisted under `${STATE_DIR}/cognito-rsa-key.pem` so tokens minted in one process verify in another. Contributed by @marcin-nowak-scl.
- **DynamoDB Streams read API** — new `ministack/services/dynamodb_streams.py` exposes `ListStreams`, `DescribeStream`, `GetShardIterator`, and `GetRecords` via `boto3.client("dynamodbstreams")` and the `streams.dynamodb.*` host. Reads the records already captured by the main DynamoDB service (emitted from `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`, `TransactWriteItems`, and `BatchWriteItem`) so the public Streams API and the internal Lambda ESM path share one source of truth. Supports all four iterator types (`TRIM_HORIZON`, `LATEST`, `AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER`, `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER`) and all four stream view types (`NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES`, `NEW_IMAGE`, `OLD_IMAGE`, `KEYS_ONLY`). Single synthetic shard per stream; opaque base64 iterator tokens. Unblocks `DynamoDbOutboxWorker`-style consumers. Contributed by @marcin-nowak-scl.
- **DynamoDB → Kinesis streaming destination** — `EnableKinesisStreamingDestination`, `DisableKinesisStreamingDestination`, `DescribeKinesisStreamingDestination`, and `UpdateKinesisStreamingDestination` on `boto3.client("dynamodb")`. Item mutations from `PutItem` / `UpdateItem` / `DeleteItem` / `TransactWriteItems` / `BatchWriteItem` fan out to every ACTIVE destination as JSON-encoded records (via `kinesis.put_record_internal`) for Kinesis / Lambda ESM / Firehose-style consumers. DISABLED destinations remain on `Describe` for the ~24h AWS window; `DeleteTable` drops destinations. The wire envelope reuses the DynamoDB Streams record shape — AWS does not publicly document the exact Kinesis envelope it produces, so MiniStack approximates it with the Streams record. Contributed by @marcin-nowak-scl.
- **Native HTTPS via `USE_SSL=1`** — the gateway listener now speaks TLS when `USE_SSL=1` (also accepts `true` / `yes`), aligning with LocalStack's `USE_SSL` flag name so a `compose.yml` switching emulator doesn't need TLS-specific changes. By default, MiniStack auto-generates a self-signed RSA cert (CN: `ministack-local`, SAN: `localhost`, `ministack`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) cached under `${TMPDIR}/ministack-tls/` so the cert survives restarts. To pin a specific cert (e.g. an `mkcert`-issued one for browser trust), set `MINISTACK_SSL_CERT` and `MINISTACK_SSL_KEY` to PEM paths. Auto-generation shells out to the `openssl` CLI (already present in both images), so no Python crypto dep is added. Unblocks AWS SDKs that hardcode `https://` against Cognito Hosted UI endpoints (e.g. Amplify v6) without needing a separate TLS-terminating proxy. Closes #526. Contributed by @prandogabriel.

### Fixed
- **Step Functions `aws-sdk:rds:removeFromGlobalCluster` left global cluster members attached** — query-protocol parameter conversion uppercased `DbClusterIdentifier` to `DBClusterIdentifier`, but the RDS API shape for `RemoveFromGlobalCluster` intentionally uses `DbClusterIdentifier`. The task now preserves that member name so a successful remove actually detaches the cluster and a following `DeleteGlobalCluster` matches AWS behavior. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **Kinesis `ListShards` `NextToken` returned a raw shard ID instead of an opaque pagination token** — AWS specifies an opaque token (length 1-1048576) with a 300-second TTL that yields `ExpiredNextTokenException` when expired. MiniStack now emits a base64url-encoded opaque token and rejects expired or malformed tokens with the AWS-correct error code, so SDKs that round-trip the token (and the rare consumers that inspect or persist it) see AWS-shape behavior.
- **DynamoDB `DescribeContinuousBackups` returned `EarliestRestorableDateTime: 0` / `LatestRestorableDateTime: 0` when PITR was disabled** — emitting Unix epoch 1970 misled SDK consumers that parsed the values into datetimes. Both fields are now omitted when `PointInTimeRecoveryStatus` is `DISABLED` and populated with a real timestamp when `ENABLED`.
- **DynamoDB `DescribeEndpoints` returned the hardcoded real-AWS endpoint `dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`** — endpoint-discovery-aware SDKs would cache that address and silently redirect subsequent calls AWAY from MiniStack to real AWS. The endpoint now reflects MiniStack's own host (`MINISTACK_HOST`:`GATEWAY_PORT`) so SDKs keep talking to the emulator.

---

## [1.3.19] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **S3 virtual-hosted and path-style integration tests** — `TestS3VhostGetPutObject` exercises both addressing styles end-to-end (simple and max-length dotted bucket names), `TestExtractS3VhostBucket` unit-tests the vhost extraction function, and `patch_endpoint_dns` lets virtual-hosted requests resolve against localhost in CI. `make_client` now accepts `additional_config_kwargs` for per-test SDK config overrides. Contributed by @mgius-ae.

### Fixed
- **S3 requests via custom `MINISTACK_HOST` hostname returned `NoSuchBucket`** — `_extract_s3_vhost_bucket` (introduced in 1.3.17) treated any dotted hostname as a virtual-hosted S3 URL, extracting the first label as a bucket name. Requests to `http://aws.private:4566` were misrouted as a vhost request for a bucket named `aws`. The function now checks the tail against `MINISTACK_HOST` and recognises all 18 documented AWS S3 virtual-hosted patterns (`s3`, `s3-accelerate`, `s3-fips`, `s3-accesspoint`, `s3-accesspoint-fips`, `s3-website`, `s3express-*`, and their dualstack/regional variants). Bare hostnames, IPv4 addresses, and `localhost` are correctly treated as path-style. Reported by @dsrosario.
- **Glue `GetDatabase` returned `LocationUri: ""` when not set** — AWS specifies a minimum length of 1 for `LocationUri`, so the empty-string default violated the spec. Now returns `null` when the field is omitted from `CreateDatabase`. Contributed by @dcrn.
- **Ruff linter not running on pull requests** — CI workflow trigger was missing the PR event.

---

## [1.3.18] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **`:latest` Docker tag pointed at the `:full` image instead of the regular Alpine image** — `docker/metadata-action`'s default `flavor: latest=auto` auto-added `:latest` to both the regular and the full meta blocks; the full build ran second and overwrote `:latest` on Docker Hub. Anyone running `docker pull ministackorg/ministack` silently got the 360 MB Debian image instead of the 110 MB Alpine one. Fixed by adding `flavor: latest=false` to the full meta block in both `docker-publish.yml` and `docker-publish-on-pr.yml` so only the regular build claims `:latest`.
- **Full image reported `version: 1.3.17-full` on `/_ministack/health`** — the `MINISTACK_VERSION` build-arg for the full image was sourced from the full meta's `outputs.version`, which includes the `-full` suffix used for tagging. Tools parsing the `version` field for semver checks saw `1.3.17-full` and rejected it. Now sourced from the regular meta's `outputs.version` so both editions report a clean `1.3.18`; the edition is already separately exposed as `edition: full`.

---

## [1.3.17] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **`ministackorg/ministack:full` Docker variant** — Debian/glibc-based superset of the regular Alpine image, adding `duckdb` (Athena engine), `psycopg2-binary` (PostgreSQL driver), and `pymysql` (MySQL driver). DuckDB and psycopg2 ship `manylinux` wheels but no `musllinux` wheels, so on Alpine they either fall back to source-builds or silently disable themselves; the `:full` tag installs them cleanly. Published in lockstep with the regular image on every release: `:full` always points at the latest Debian build, alongside `:{version}-full` and `:{major}.{minor}-full`. The regular `:latest` / `:{version}` tags are unchanged. Full image reports `edition: full` on `/_ministack/health`; regular reports `edition: light`. Closes the long-standing Athena-on-Alpine gap raised by @arischow.
- **STS `GetWebIdentityToken` action** — implements AWS-spec validation: `SigningAlgorithm` is required and must be `RS256` or `ES384`; `Audience.member.N` is required, 1–10 items × 1–1000 chars; `DurationSeconds` is bounded 60–3600 (default 300). Returns a parseable JWT for OIDC dev flows. Signature is HS256 (not the publicly-verifiable RS256/ES384 real STS publishes via JWKS) — sufficient for emulator workloads that inspect claims, not for clients that verify against AWS JWKS. Requested by @anghel93.

### Fixed
- **Step Functions child execution integrations now return child execution metadata** — `arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution` starts the nested execution and returns `ExecutionArn` / `StartDate` instead of echoing the request payload. `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sfn:startExecution` now accepts AWS Step Functions' PascalCase integration parameters (`StateMachineArn`, `Input`, `Name`) by translating them to MiniStack's lower-camel Step Functions API shape. Existing `.sync` and `.waitForTaskToken` paths preserved. Contributed by @jayjanssen.
- **STS `GetCallerIdentity` returned `arn:aws:iam::{account}:root` regardless of credentials** — tests obtaining temporary credentials via `AssumeRole` and then verifying the assumed-role identity could never confirm the role. Handler now extracts the `AccessKeyId` from the SigV4 `Authorization` header and looks it up in a session map populated by `AssumeRole` / `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, returning the matching `arn:aws:sts::{account}:assumed-role/{role}/{session}` ARN and `{role-id}:{session}` UserId. Falls back to root for non-session credentials. Contributed by @hectormauer.
- **S3 virtual-hosted-style routing broke on non-`localhost` endpoints** — `_S3_VHOST_RE` was anchored to `_MINISTACK_HOST` (default `localhost`), so requests with `Host: bucket.ministack:4566` (Docker Compose service name) or any custom hostname fell through to S3 path-style with the wrong bucket — silently breaking AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 setups. Replaced with `_extract_s3_vhost_bucket(host)` which validates against AWS bucket-naming rules (3–63 chars, lowercase + digits + dots + hyphens, alphanum start/end, no `..`, not IPv4) and accepts any tail — vhost works against `localhost`, `ministack`, custom DNS, or `s3.amazonaws.com` without configuration. Verified against 40 host-header cases. The dead vhost branch in `s3.py:_parse_bucket_key` is removed since the rewrite happens at the routing layer. Reported by @mgius-ae.
- **Lambda routing missed every API path that wasn't `/2015-03-31/functions`** — the path-based service detector only matched the original Lambda API version date, so unsigned requests to `/2019-09-25/functions/.../event-invoke-config` (`PutFunctionEventInvokeConfig`), `/2019-09-30/functions/.../provisioned-concurrency`, `/2021-10-31/functions/.../url`, `/2018-10-31/layers`, `/2015-03-31/event-source-mappings`, `/2015-03-31/tags`, `/2016-08-19/account-settings`, `/2018-06-01/runtime/...`, and `/2020-04-22/code-signing-configs/...` all fell through to S3. boto3 always signs (so it routed via SigV4 credential scope), but raw HTTP / curl / the Lambda Runtime API itself missed. Detector now matches `^/{date}/{lambda-resource}/...` for every documented resource.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::Lambda::Function` never fetched S3 code** — `_lambda_create` stored `Code.S3Bucket` / `Code.S3Key` as metadata but never resolved them against the in-memory S3 service, so every CFN-deployed S3-backed Lambda had `code_zip = None` and failed to invoke. Inline `ZipFile` was unaffected; everything else broken. Provisioner now fetches the bytes via the standard Lambda S3 helper. Contributed by @hiddengearz.
- **Lambda warm-worker execution path was missing standard runtime env vars** — `lambda_runtime.py`'s warm-worker path didn't inject `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION`, or `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME`, while the Docker execution path already did. Functions calling `boto3.client(...)`, X-Ray tracers, CloudWatch metric emitters, and any code branching on `$LATEST` vs published versions ran with an inconsistent environment compared to AWS. Warm-worker now injects the full set, matching Docker mode and AWS spec. Contributed by @hiddengearz.
- **4 AWS wire-format compliance bugs.** STS `AssumeRole` / `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` returned `arn:aws:iam::...:assumed-role/...` for the assumed-role principal — real AWS uses `arn:aws:sts::...:assumed-role/{role}/{session}` (any IAM-policy `Condition: aws:PrincipalArn` checking against the sts shape would mismatch). API Gateway v1 `PutIntegration` returned HTTP 200 instead of 201. EventBridge `StartReplay` started in `RUNNING` state instead of `STARTING` (background thread still transitions `RUNNING` → `COMPLETED`). SNS `Subscribe` returned `PendingConfirmation` as `SubscriptionArn` for HTTP/email pending subscriptions — real AWS returns lowercase `pending confirmation` (with the space).

---
## [1.3.16] — 2026-04-27

### Added
- **`BIND_HOST` env var to configure the listen interface** — `BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1 ministack` now restricts the listener to loopback for `pip install` users on shared dev machines. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`, so existing setups are unchanged. Distinct from `MINISTACK_HOST` (the virtual hostname used for S3 virtual-host / execute-api URL matching). Contributed by @mattwang44.
- **Lambda `Code.S3ObjectVersion` honoured end-to-end** — `CreateFunction`, `UpdateFunctionCode`, `PublishLayerVersion`, and the CloudFormation `AWS::Lambda::Function` provisioner all thread the version through to S3, so Terraform `aws_lambda_function.s3_object_version` and CDK `Code.fromBucket(..., objectVersion=...)` deploy the pinned bytes instead of silently picking up the latest.

### Fixed
- **Lambda 250 MB unzipped-size limit was not enforced** — `CreateFunction` / `UpdateFunctionCode` / `PublishLayerVersion` accepted oversize zips and failed only at invocation time. All three now reject up-front with `InvalidParameterValueException`, matching AWS.
- **S3 with `S3_PERSIST=1`: versioned object bodies capped at 10 MB and `GetObject(VersionId)` returned 500 for larger multipart uploads** — bodies now persist to disk (in-memory record drops the body, on-demand reads stream back), versioned reads return the persisted bytes, and disk writes go through atomic `tmp+rename` with mode `0o600` / dir `0o700` plus a path-traversal guard that rejects keys resolving outside `S3_DATA_DIR`.
- **Persisted Cognito hosted-UI / federation `_auth_codes` lost across warm-boot** — `_auth_codes` had a 5-minute TTL but was declared "ephemeral, not persisted", so any in-flight hosted-UI sign-in straddling a warm-boot was silently invalidated. Now wired into `get_state` / `restore_state` so codes survive a restart up to their normal TTL. Plain-dict choice (no `AccountScopedDict`) preserved with a corrected rationale: none of the OAuth2 endpoints carry SigV4, so wrapping in `AccountScopedDict` would be functionally equivalent. Contributed by @bognari.
- **`PERSIST_STATE=1`: twelve mutated state dicts were silently dropped on warm-boot.** Five wired in by @bognari (`secretsmanager._resource_policies`, `kinesis._consumers`, `ecs._attributes`, `sns._platform_applications`, `sns._platform_endpoints`) — without these, `aws_secretsmanager_secret_policy`, `aws_kinesis_stream_consumer`, ECS PutAttributes, and mobile-push topology silently disappeared on restart. Plus `cloudwatch_logs._destinations` / `_metric_filters` / `_queries` (also @bognari) — log-destinations and metric filters wiped on restart. Plus the seven follow-ups for the same bug family: `sqs._queue_name_to_url` (snapshotted via `dict(asd)` instead of `copy.deepcopy`, dropping every non-current-tenant mapping), `eventbridge._event_bus_policies` / `_connections` / `_api_destinations` (every `aws_cloudwatch_event_connection` and `aws_cloudwatch_event_api_destination` lost), `ssm._parameter_history` and `_tags` (`GetParameterHistory` returned empty after warm-boot), and `lambda_svc._kinesis_positions` / `_dynamodb_stream_positions` (every restart replayed event-source-mapping streams from `StartingPosition`, a real at-least-once-delivery violation).
- **Persisted services failed to restore on startup for autoscaling / backup / eks / scheduler / pipes** — these five services declared `restore_state` but never invoked it on import, so warm-boots came up with empty state regardless of `PERSIST_STATE=1`. Wired in. Contributed by @bognari.
- **Eager-imported non-routable persisted services on startup** — services without an HTTP route never imported, so their `load_state` block never fired and persisted state evaporated. Eager-import now triggers restore. Contributed by @bognari.
- **`NameError` at import on warm-boot for any persisted service whose `restore_state` referenced a forward-declared symbol** — parametrized regression test added across every persisted service to catch the import-order shape that previously hit `lambda_svc._ensure_poller`, `ecs._attributes`, and `acm._synthetic_pem`. Contributed by @bognari.
- **ACM `GetCertificate` returned a placeholder PEM and leaked private-key bytes to disk on `RequestCertificate` issuance** — body / chain fidelity now matches real AWS shape, and the private-key disk-leak path is scrubbed. Contributed by @bognari.
- **API Gateway v2 integration `physicalId` returned `{apiId}/{integrationId}` instead of just `{integrationId}`** — broke `Ref` resolution against `aws_apigatewayv2_integration`, so route → integration lookup failed at request time and CFN-deployed HTTP APIs returned `500 No integration configured` for every request. `Ref` now matches AWS; `handle_execute` and `_invoke_ws_lambda` defensively strip a legacy `{apiId}/` prefix so existing stacks continue to work. Contributed by @hiddengearz.
- **API Gateway v1 `PutIntegration` dropped `contentHandling`** — the field was accepted on create but never persisted, so `CONVERT_TO_TEXT` / `CONVERT_TO_BINARY` payload translation silently no-op'd. Contributed by @bognari.
- **SNS → SQS raw delivery did not forward message attributes** — raw subscriptions delivered the message body but stripped `MessageAttributes`, so SQS receivers never saw them. Forwarded now, plus the follow-up that adds the matching `MD5OfMessageAttributes` header so Java / Go SDK receivers (which verify the digest) match real AWS. Contributed by @arischow.
- **Three medium / low correctness bugs.** `apigateway` and `apigateway_v1` `get_state()` returned live `AccountScopedDict` references instead of deep copies, so a concurrent write during shutdown serialisation could corrupt the persisted snapshot. `secretsmanager._delete_secret(force=True)` deleted the secret but left orphan entries in `_resource_policies` keyed by ARN — invisible to the API but accumulating in memory and surviving warm-boot. `acm._list_certificates` returned `{"NextToken": null}` unconditionally — boto3 strips it client-side, but Java / Go / raw-HTTP pagination clients that loop on `if NextToken in response` looped forever. Contributed by @bognari. Pattern extended in this release with a sweep across `ses_v2`, `apigateway` v2, and `apigateway` v1 (ten more endpoints) so every list response now omits `NextToken` when there is no next page; AppSync's GraphQL `{items, nextToken}` shape is intentionally unchanged.
- **`/health` reported `version: dev` in the published Docker image** — `pip` is stripped from the runtime image, so the `importlib.metadata` lookup that worked under `pip install ministack` returned the fallback. Now reads from a `MINISTACK_VERSION` env var injected at image build time.

## [1.3.15] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **AWS Backup service** — 21 operations across vaults, plans, selections, jobs, and tagging. Multi-tenant via `AccountScopedDict`, persisted, and integrated with the Resource Groups Tagging API. Jobs return `COMPLETED` immediately — sufficient for Terraform `aws_backup_*` IaC validation, no real backup is performed. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil.
- **EventBridge archive event storage and replay dispatch** — `PutEvents` writes matching events to active archives (incrementing `EventCount`), and `StartReplay` re-dispatches the snapshot to the destination bus in a background thread so the destination's current rules and targets fire. Archives persist; replays surviving a restart are flipped to `FAILED`. Closes the long-standing "stored but not dispatched" gap. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil.
- **Transfer Family — real SFTP server** — `asyncssh`-backed listener on `:2222` (override with `SFTP_PORT`), backed by ministack's S3 state. Public-key auth resolves the user, server, and account in one shot — no `username$serverid` decoration. `SFTP_PORT_PER_SERVER=1` allocates one port per server from `SFTP_BASE_PORT` (default 2300). `HomeDirectoryType=PATH` and `LOGICAL` both honored. Host key persists when `PERSIST_STATE=1`. Adds `StartServer` / `StopServer` (`OFFLINE` servers refuse auth). `asyncssh` lives under the `[full]` extra; the base install serves the control plane and skips the listener.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Integration` and `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Route` provisioners** — completes the API Gateway v2 CFN surface, enabling full CDK HTTP API deployments (`HttpApi.addRoutes()`) against ministack. Both support `Fn::GetAtt` (`IntegrationId`, `RouteId`) and idempotent delete. Contributed by @hiddengearz.
- **Step Functions alias API** — `Create/Update/Delete/Describe/ListStateMachineAliases` plus alias ARN resolution on `DescribeStateMachine`. Validation matches AWS (name regex, weights summing to 100, referenced versions must exist). `DeleteStateMachineVersion` now refuses to drop a version an alias still routes to. Unblocks `terraform plan` on `aws_sfn_state_machine` under provider v6, which unconditionally calls `ListStateMachineAliases` on every refresh. Contributed by @mattwang44.
- **Step Functions versioning API** — `Publish/Delete/ListStateMachineVersions` plus qualified-ARN resolution on `DescribeStateMachine`. `CreateStateMachine` accepts `publish=True`. Optimistic concurrency via `revisionId`; version numbers are monotonic and never reused after delete. Same terraform-provider-aws v6 motivation as the alias API. Contributed by @mattwang44.
- **CloudWatch Logs Delivery API** — 12 actions across `DeliverySource` / `DeliveryDestination` / `Delivery` (the 2023-era replacement for subscription filters that vended-logs producers like Bedrock and AppSync use to ship to S3 / CWL / Firehose). Server-derived `service` and `deliveryDestinationType`, `outputFormat` validated against the AWS enum, one-Delivery-per-pair enforced with `ConflictException`. Contributed by @mattwang44.

### Fixed
- **RDS Postgres 18+ container refused to start** — `postgres:18+` images moved to a major-version-specific data layout ([docker-library/postgres#1259](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/pull/1259)) and refused to start with the pre-18 mount path. Mount path is now chosen per major: `/var/lib/postgresql/data` for < 18 (unchanged), `/var/lib/postgresql` for ≥ 18. MySQL / MariaDB / Aurora MySQL unaffected. Also adds `postgres 18.3`, `17.5`, `16.4` to `DescribeDBEngineVersions`. Reported and contributed by @whittin3.

### Changed
- **RDS containers mount only the engine-appropriate data path** — previously both `/var/lib/postgresql/data` and `/var/lib/mysql` were mounted on every container regardless of engine. Harmless but wasteful and opaque when debugging.

---

## [1.3.14] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`DOCKER_NETWORK` env var unifies container networking across RDS / EKS / ElastiCache / Lambda** — a single knob that replaces the old `$HOSTNAME` auto-detection (which silently failed under docker-compose) and subsumes the legacy `LAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK`. When set, RDS and ElastiCache also switch `Endpoint.Address` to the routable container IP instead of `localhost`, so Lambda containers on the same network can actually reach them. `LAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK` is still accepted as a fallback for backwards compatibility. Contributed by @bognari.
- **`LAMBDA_DOCKER_FLAGS` env var for Lambda container customisation** — matches LocalStack's convention for injecting `docker run` flags into Lambda containers. Supports `-e` / `--env`, `-v` / `--volume`, `--dns`, `--network`, `--cap-add`, `-m` / `--memory`, `--shm-size`, `--tmpfs`, `--add-host`, `--privileged`, `--read-only`. Unblocks TLS-proxy / custom-CA / routed-dev-network setups used in local Kubernetes environments. Default unset → behaviour identical to AWS. Contributed by @hzhou0.
- **`MINISTACK_IMAGE_PREFIX` routes nested images through a private registry** — Testcontainers' `hub.image.name.prefix` now propagates to every nested real-infra image (RDS postgres/mysql/mariadb, ElastiCache redis/memcached, EKS k3s, Lambda runtime images under `public.ecr.aws/lambda/*`). Air-gapped and proxy-only environments no longer need to accept docker.io pulls for real-infra containers. The Java Testcontainers module forwards the prefix automatically. Reported by @TJ-developer.
- **Testcontainers Java module reaps orphaned MiniStack containers and volumes on `stop()`** — RDS / ECS / EKS / ElastiCache nested containers spawned on the host engine are no longer leaked after the test run, closing a long-standing Podman-visible leak. The reaper labels all sidecar resources `ministack=<service>` and removes them via the DockerClient regardless of the host engine (Docker or Podman).
- **Secrets Manager `ListSecrets` honours `IncludePlannedDeletion`** — soft-deleted secrets are now returned when the flag is set, with `DeletedDate` populated on each entry per the AWS `SecretListEntry` spec. Unblocks clients that poll `list-secrets --include-planned-deletion` to confirm a soft delete. Contributed by @weeco.

### Fixed
- **S3 zero-byte `PutObject` checksum mismatch with Java SDK v2** — the aws-chunked decoder mishandled zero-byte streaming PUTs (a single terminator chunk `0;chunk-signature=…\r\n\r\n`): it correctly broke the loop on `chunk_size == 0` but then fell through without replacing the body, leaving the raw chunked framing as the "body" bytes. The computed ETag (`0cabc165…`, MD5 of the wrapper) mismatched the client's expected ETag (`d41d8cd9…`, MD5 of empty content), and Java SDK v2 surfaced a `RetryableException: Data read has a different checksum than expected`. Reported by @JoeHale.
- **SNS HTTP subscription confirmation silently skipped** — the handler imported `aiohttp` at call time, but `aiohttp` was never a declared dependency and wasn't in the Docker image, so every HTTP subscribe delivered an `aiohttp not installed — subscription confirmation skipped` log and no POST. Replaced with `urllib.request` wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`, honouring the no-new-deps rule. Userinfo in URLs (`http://user:pass@host/…`) is promoted to `Authorization: Basic` per real AWS SNS behaviour. Reported by @anghel93.
- **RDS `DescribeDBInstances` SigV4 JSON protocol** — Java and Go SDKs that negotiate the JSON variant (rather than Query) were hitting the fallback handler; `DescribeDBInstances` now speaks both shapes. Aurora-cluster `DBClusterMembers` membership is populated correctly when instances are created inside a cluster.
- **Lambda RIE container log isolation** — warm RIE containers accumulate stdout/stderr across every invocation; without a `since` filter the response bundled every prior invocation's logs, ballooning `LogResult` unpredictably and making `LogType=Tail` debugging useless. `container.logs(since=invoke_time)` now returns only the current invocation's lines, matching real Lambda. Contributed by @ksjoberg.
- **Lambda RIE retry loop no longer waits 100ms on the first attempt** — the `time.sleep(0.1)` was at the top of the retry loop, costing every RIE invocation a 100ms floor even when the container was already listening. Sleep is now paid only on `URLError` / `ConnectionRefusedError` retries. Hot-path savings: ~100ms per warm RIE invoke. Contributed by @ksjoberg.
- **Lambda warm-pool container memory probe halves in latency** — `container.stats(stream=False)` without `one_shot=True` collects two stat samples 1 second apart to compute CPU deltas, which MiniStack doesn't need (we only read `memory_stats.max_usage`). Added `one_shot=True` per the Docker API docs; saves ~1 second per `_probe_peak_memory_mb` call. Contributed by @ksjoberg.
- **Lambda slash-form Python handler paths** — `Handler: "pkg/sub/mod.fn"` (common in cookiecutter Lambda templates) now resolves the same way AWS's `awslambdaric` bootstrap does (`modname.replace("/", ".")`). Contributed by @ksjoberg.

### Changed
- **`aiohttp` removed from SNS HTTP delivery path** — replaced with stdlib `urllib.request.urlopen` wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`. Honours MiniStack's no-new-deps rule (Docker image size, idle RAM, attack surface). Back-compat preserved — same call sites, same logging shape.
- **Server bumps asyncio default executor to 64 threads on startup** — lifespan hook installs a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=64)` before the first request. The Python default (6 threads on 2-core CI runners) could stall concurrent Lambda cold-starts behind blocking work, causing intermittent test-side urlopen timeouts. Override with `MINISTACK_WORKER_THREADS`.

---

## [1.3.13] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **CloudFront Functions API (stub)** — `CreateFunction`, `DescribeFunction`, `GetFunction`, `ListFunctions`, `PublishFunction`, `UpdateFunction`, `DeleteFunction` under `/2020-05-31/function*`. Covers Terraform `aws_cloudfront_function` (create + publish + read + delete) and attaching a function ARN to distribution cache behaviors. Limitations: in-memory only; no `TestFunction`; `KeyValueStoreAssociations` not modelled; no execution at the edge; `DescribeFunction` requires the `Stage` query parameter (`DEVELOPMENT` \| `LIVE`); `UpdateFunction` invalidates the emulated LIVE revision until the next `PublishFunction`. Contributed by @david-hay.
- **CloudFront `CreateDistributionWithTags`** — accepts the `DistributionConfigWithTags` wrapper body shape (Terraform `aws_cloudfront_distribution` with `tags`). Contributed by @david-hay.
- **API Gateway v1 stage method-settings via JSON Patch** — `UpdateStage` now honours paths of the form `/{resourcePath}/{httpMethod}/metrics/enabled`, `…/logging/loglevel`, `…/throttling/burstLimit`, etc., mapping them into `stage.methodSettings[{resourcePath}/{httpMethod}]` with AWS-shaped defaults. Unblocks Terraform `aws_api_gateway_method_settings`. Contributed by @david-hay.
- **API Gateway execute-api for `provided.*` / Image / non-Python-Node runtimes** — AWS_PROXY integrations now dispatch through the central `_execute_function` path, so Go / Rust / Java Lambdas actually execute (v1 and v2) instead of returning a canned mock. Contributed by @david-hay and @bognari.
- **Lambda → CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway-triggered invocations** — every execute-api invoke now emits the standard `START RequestId:` / handler stdout+stderr / `END RequestId:` / `REPORT RequestId:` sequence to `/aws/lambda/{FunctionName}`, so Metric Filters and subscription filters that watch APIGW-behind-Lambda traffic trigger correctly. Contributed by @bognari.

### Fixed
- **S3 Control `TagResource` silently dropped tags** — the handler only had `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` branches and parsed bodies as JSON, but AWS SDK Go v2 (used by terraform-aws-provider v6+) sends `POST` with an XML `TagResourceRequest`. Tags posted by Terraform's `aws_s3_bucket.tags` + `default_tags` were returning 2xx but never persisted, producing perpetual drift. Handler now accepts both POST and PUT, and parses both XML and JSON request bodies. Reported by @whittin3.
- **IAM `GetPolicy` / `ListPolicies` omitted `Tags`** — `_managed_policy_xml()` never emitted a `<Tags>` block even though `TagPolicy` stored them correctly; Terraform refreshed `tags_all = {}` and replanned `default_tags` on every apply. Also fixed `_create_policy` silently dropping `Tags` passed on create. Same bug class as `_user_xml` (#441). Reported by @whittin3.
- **EC2 tag-drift across 10+ resource types** — fourteen hardcoded `<tagSet/>` emissions in `ec2.py` were dropping tags for Network Interfaces, VPC Endpoints, NAT Gateways, Network ACLs, VPC Peering Connections, DHCP Options, Egress-Only Internet Gateways, Managed Prefix Lists, VPN Gateways, and Customer Gateways. Every `Describe*` for those resources returned empty tags regardless of what was stored. All now route through `_tag_set_xml(resource_id)`; three create paths (VPC Peering, DHCP Options, Egress-Only IGW) additionally gained missing `_parse_tag_specs` hooks so `TagSpecifications` on create is honoured.

### Changed
- **Lambda warm-worker stderr drain is bounded, not a fixed sleep** — the 50ms `time.sleep` added alongside the API Gateway → CloudWatch Logs fix was paid by every warm invocation regardless of whether the handler emitted log output. Replaced with a bounded drain that polls the stderr queue at 1ms intervals, exits ~5ms after the last line arrives (or ~50ms if the handler emitted nothing at all), and caps at 250ms absolute. Typical overhead drops from 50ms to 1–10ms per invoke.
- **API Gateway proxy error-shaping shares a helper** — both v1 and v2 now call `lambda_svc.lambda_execute_result_to_api_proxy_response(...)` when converting an `_execute_function` result to the AWS_PROXY envelope. Gains correct `429 Too Many Requests` responses on `ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded` throttles (previously returned 502), and keeps v1/v2 response shapes aligned.

---

## [1.3.12] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **CloudFront Functions API (stub)** — `CreateFunction`, `DescribeFunction`, `GetFunction`, `ListFunctions`, `PublishFunction`, `UpdateFunction`, and `DeleteFunction` under `/2020-05-31/function*`, returning XML `FunctionSummary` / `FunctionList` plus `ETag` headers where the AWS SDK expects them, and raw function bytes on `GetFunction`. Covers Terraform `aws_cloudfront_function` (create + `publish` + read + delete) and attaching a function ARN to distribution cache behaviors. **Limitations:** in-memory only (same persistence bucket as other CloudFront state); no `TestFunction`; `KeyValueStoreAssociations` are not modeled (responses use empty associations); no execution of CloudFront Functions at the edge; `DescribeFunction` requires the `Stage` query parameter (`DEVELOPMENT` \| `LIVE`), matching AWS; `UpdateFunction` invalidates the emulated LIVE revision until the next `PublishFunction`. Contributed by @david-hay.

### Fixed
- **EC2 `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` failed on duplicate rules** — ingress authorization returned `InvalidPermission.Duplicate` when Terraform re-submitted an unchanged rule, while egress already treated duplicates as a no-op. Ingress is now idempotent in the same way, so `aws_security_group` updates no longer fail on re-authorize. Contributed by @david-hay.
- **IAM `CreatePolicy` `Description` field lost on warm boot** — the field was silently dropped on create and never emitted by `GetPolicy`. Because `description` is `ForceNew` in the Terraform AWS provider, every `aws_iam_policy` with a description planned destroy-and-recreate on every warm boot, taking every attached `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` with it. `CreatePolicy` now stores `Description` and the managed-policy XML emits `<Description>` when non-empty (omitted otherwise, matching real AWS). Reported by @whittin3.
- **IAM `GetUser` omitted tags** — `_user_xml()` never emitted a `<Tags>` block even though `CreateUser`/`TagUser` stored them correctly, so Terraform refresh saw `tags_all = {}` and replanned `default_tags` on every apply. `_user_xml()` now mirrors `_role_xml()`'s tag serialization. Reported by @whittin3.
- **Lambda `CreateAlias` / `UpdateAlias` echoed phantom `RoutingConfig`** — Terraform sends `RoutingConfig: {"AdditionalVersionWeights": {}}` even when no weighted routing is declared; the existing truthy guard stored the empty shape and `GetAlias` replayed it, so Terraform planned to remove the block on every apply. Routing config is now stored only when `AdditionalVersionWeights` is non-empty, matching real AWS's "omit when empty" response shape; clearing to empty via `UpdateAlias` explicitly removes the field. Reported by @whittin3.
- **Lambda `CreateEventSourceMapping` silently dropped `Tags`** — the request body's `Tags` parameter was never read, so `ListTags` returned `{}` for any ESM ARN and Terraform re-added tags on every apply. `CreateEventSourceMapping` now stores `Tags`, and `ListTags` / `TagResource` / `UntagResource` all route ESM ARNs (`arn:aws:lambda:…:event-source-mapping:<uuid>`) to the ESM record. Reported by @whittin3.
- **API Gateway v2 `contentHandlingStrategy` not persisted** — `CreateIntegration` accepted the field but never stored it, `UpdateIntegration` wasn't in the allowlist, and `GetIntegration` never echoed it. Terraform planned an in-place update adding the field back on every `apply`, and at runtime requests lost `CONVERT_TO_TEXT` / `CONVERT_TO_BINARY` payload translation. All three paths now honour the field. Reported by @whittin3.

---

## [1.3.11] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`GET /_ministack/ses/messages` email inspection endpoint** — returns every SES message sent across v1 and v2 APIs (`SendEmail`, `SendRawEmail`, `SendTemplatedEmail`, `SendBulkTemplatedEmail`, v2 `SendEmail`), grouped by account ID. Accepts an optional `?account=<12-digit-id>` query parameter to filter. Invalid account IDs return a 400 `InvalidAccountID` error. Unlocks end-to-end testing for flows that send password-reset / verification / transactional emails without a real SMTP sink. Contributed by @jgrumboe.
- **API Gateway v1 `GetAccount` / `UpdateAccount`** — `/account` now responds with the AWS-shaped defaults (`throttleSettings`, `features`, `apiKeyVersion`) and honours `UpdateAccount` patches (typically `/cloudwatchRoleArn`). Unblocks `terraform apply` on `aws_api_gateway_account`, which previously failed with `NotFoundException: Unknown path: /account`. Reported by @david-hay.

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v1 `policy` field broke `terraform plan` refresh** — ministack returned the REST API policy as a plain JSON string; terraform-provider-aws's `flattenAPIPolicy` wraps the SDK-decoded value in outer quotes and re-parses as JSON (`NormalizeJsonString("\"" + policy + "\"")` then `strconv.Unquote`), so the unescaped inner quotes made Go's decoder error with `invalid character 'S' after top-level value` as soon as the policy contained `"Statement"`. The wire now matches real AWS, which returns the `policy` already JSON-string escape-encoded — Terraform's wrap-and-reparse recovers the original policy JSON unchanged. Fix applied at emit time across `CreateRestApi`, `GetRestApi`, `GetRestApis`, and `UpdateRestApi`; internal reads (CFN, other services) keep seeing the raw policy. Reported by @david-hay.

---

## [1.3.10] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **DynamoDB `DeletionProtectionEnabled` silently ignored on `CreateTable` / `UpdateTable`** — the table description never surfaced the field, and `DeleteTable` always succeeded regardless. Terraform's `aws_dynamodb_table` treats deletion protection as a safety-critical drift detector, so tables created with `deletion_protection_enabled = true` appeared unprotected and could be destroyed by a `terraform destroy` that real AWS would have refused. `CreateTable` now stores the flag (defaulting to `False`), `UpdateTable` toggles it, `DescribeTable` returns the current value, and `DeleteTable` refuses with `ValidationException: Table can't be deleted as deletion protection is enabled` when it's on — matching AWS behaviour exactly.
- **S3 `ListBuckets` missing `BucketArn` and `BucketRegion`** — the response contained only `Name` and `CreationDate`, so SDKs/tooling that consumed the newer fields (added by AWS in 2024) received `None` and either errored or silently skipped buckets. `ListBuckets` now emits both fields per bucket (`BucketArn` as `arn:aws:s3:::<name>`, `BucketRegion` from the bucket's stored region or `MINISTACK_REGION`). Reported by @mcdoit.

---

## [1.3.9] — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **S3 bucket logging / accelerate / request-payment config never persisted** — `s3.get_state()` and `s3.restore_state()` only enumerated 11 of the 14 module-level `_bucket_*` dicts, so `_bucket_logging_config`, `_bucket_accelerate_config`, and `_bucket_request_payment_config` silently evaporated on warm boot. `GetBucketLogging` / `GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration` / `GetBucketRequestPayment` returned empty responses on restart even though the config was set pre-shutdown. Fixed by replacing the hand-maintained enumeration with a `_PERSISTED_BUCKET_DICTS` registry (one entry per global, driven by a single iteration in both functions), closing the entire class of "forgot to add the new dict to get_state/restore_state" bug. Reported by @whittin3.
- **EC2 `tag:*` / `tag-key` / `tag-value` filters ignored on most `Describe*` calls** — instance tag filters landed in 1.3.8 (contributed by @costi) but the same gap existed on security groups, route tables, NAT gateways, network ACLs, flow logs, VPC peering connections, prefix lists, VPN gateways, and launch templates — each did its own inline filter logic and silently accepted every resource regardless of `tag:*`. Factored tag filter handling into a shared `_resource_matches_tag_filters` helper and wired it into every `Describe*` call that already parses filters. Also added `tag-value` (match by value across any key) and AWS-compatible wildcard support (`*` / `?`) to every tag filter. Reported by @costi.
- **EC2 `DescribeImages` missing `RootDeviceName` + `BlockDeviceMappings`** — built-in stub AMIs returned `RootDeviceType: ebs` but omitted the root device name and block device mapping entirely, so Terraform's AWS provider errored with `finding Root Device Name for AMI` before ever reaching `RunInstances`. CLI `run-instances` was unaffected (doesn't consult these fields). Stubs now expose `/dev/xvda` for Linux AMIs and `/dev/sda1` for the Windows Server stub, with an 8 GB `gp2` EBS block device mapping; the Windows stub also now reports `Platform=windows`, matching AWS. Reported by @fatmoon.

### Changed
- **`_parse_filters` consumers share a single tag-matching helper** — the three `_matches_*_filters` functions (instances, VPCs, subnets) and 9 inline filter sites now all call `_resource_matches_tag_filters(resource_id, filters)` instead of re-implementing `tag:` handling per resource. New EC2 resource types need zero tag-filter code — the helper walks the resource's entry in `_tags` and short-circuits on the first failing tag predicate.
- **ECS exited-container reaper** — `RunTask` spawned containers via `docker run -d` without `auto_remove`, so every short-lived task command (e.g. `echo`, `wget` probes) exited but left an `Exited (0)` container on the Docker daemon indefinitely. `StopTask` and `/_ministack/reset` only ever listed running containers, so the exited ones accumulated across sessions. A background daemon thread now sweeps exited `ministack=ecs` containers every `ECS_REAP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 60), `reset()` now reaps exited containers alongside running ones, and the reaper starts lazily on first `RunTask` so no-docker install paths are unaffected.

---

## [1.3.8] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- **S3 `s3:TestEvent` on `PutBucketNotificationConfiguration`** — configuring bucket notifications now delivers a flat `s3:TestEvent` payload (no `Records` wrapper) to every SQS / SNS / Lambda destination, matching real AWS S3 behaviour so tooling that listens for the test event on bucket setup works locally. Contributed by @nigel-campbell.

### Fixed
- **Lambda persistence crash on warm start with any event source mapping** — `lambda_svc.restore_state()` called `_ensure_poller()` when restoring ESMs, but the module-level invocation ran at line 170 while `_ensure_poller` was defined ~3,500 lines later. Warm starts with `PERSIST_STATE=1` and an ESM in `lambda.json` raised `NameError: name '_ensure_poller' is not defined` on every Lambda request until the state file was deleted. The module-level load/restore is now at the bottom of the file, after every helper it may call. Reported by @whittin3.
- **DynamoDB `SSEDescription` used the request shape instead of the response shape** — `CreateTable` stored the caller's `SSESpecification` (`Enabled`/`KMSMasterKeyId`) directly as the response `SSEDescription`, which is missing the `Status` field Terraform v6 waits on; `UpdateTable` silently ignored `SSESpecification`. Warm-boot `terraform apply` on any encrypted table hung forever with `unexpected state '', wanted target 'DISABLED, ENABLED'`. Fixed by converting spec → description (`Status`, `SSEType`, `KMSMasterKeyArn`) at create + update, plus a one-shot migration in `restore_state` for legacy persisted tables. Reported by @whittin3.
- **`test_s3_put_notification_sends_test_event` was flaky under parallel load** — background thread delivering `s3:TestEvent` raced the test's poll. `PutBucketNotification` now delivers the test event synchronously (matching AWS effective behaviour) before returning; removes the race and also fixes multi-tenant delivery where the worker thread lost the caller's account contextvar.

### Changed
- **Hardened persisted-state restore across every service** — 35 service modules wrapped their module-level `load_state()` + `restore_state()` invocation in `try/except` so a corrupt or schema-incompatible `{service}.json` logs and continues with a fresh store instead of breaking the service at import. Audited every `restore_state` / `load_persisted_state` for forward references (0 other violators) and unsafe `data[key]` subscript accesses (all guarded).

---

## [1.3.7] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v2 Lambda integrations 502'd on the Terraform-produced wrapper URI** — 1.3.6's #407 fix passed the full APIGW wrapper `arn:aws:apigateway:<region>:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/<lambda-arn>/invocations` to the name/qualifier parser, which split on `:` and mis-read `("aws", "lambda")` as function + qualifier (error text: `Lambda function 'aws' (qualifier 'lambda') not found`). Broke every v2 HTTP + WebSocket integration using `aws_lambda_function.*.invoke_arn` / `aws_lambda_alias.*.invoke_arn`, with no Terraform-layer workaround. New `_extract_lambda_ref_from_integration_uri` helper unwraps the nested Lambda ARN before parsing, covering all 12 observed URI shapes (wrapped ± alias/version/$LATEST, bare ARN, plain name, cross-account, malformed trailing `/invocations`). Reported by @whittin3. Fixes #409
- **Unknown `/_localstack/*` paths returned S3 `NoSuchBucket` XML** — probes from LocalStack-migrated tooling (e.g. `/_localstack/info`, `/_localstack/plugins`, `/_localstack/init`) fell through to the S3 handler. ministack now returns a clear 404 JSON pointing callers at the `/_ministack/*` endpoints. `/_localstack/health` is unaffected (matched earlier in the dispatch chain). Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#413). Fixes #386

---

## [1.3.6] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **API Gateway path-based data plane** — REST + HTTP + WebSocket APIs are now reachable without `*.execute-api.localhost` Host overrides: `http(s)://localhost:4566/_aws/execute-api/{apiId}/{stage}/{path}` (v1 + v2 HTTP + v2 WS) and the LocalStack-legacy `http://localhost:4566/restapis/{apiId}/{stage}/_user_request_/{path}` (v1). Unblocks macOS browsers (no `*.localhost` DNS resolution) and strict HTTP clients with no Host override.
- **Custom/predictable API Gateway IDs** — `aws_apigatewayv2_api` and `aws_apigateway_rest_api` honour an `ms-custom-id` tag on `CreateApi` / `CreateRestApi` and pin the generated `apiId` / REST API id to the tag value. Duplicates in the same account return `ConflictException` (409). The LocalStack `ls-custom-id` tag is intentionally rejected with a clear `BadRequestException` (400) pointing callers at the ministack-native key. Reported by @whittin3. Fixes #400
- **Cognito `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient` CFN `GenerateSecret`** — CloudFormation-provisioned user pool clients now generate a client secret when `GenerateSecret: true`, matching the native Cognito API path. Contributed by @mgius-ae (#403)

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v2 HTTP API — `$default` stage treated first path segment as stage name** — an API configured with the `$default` stage returned `404 "Stage 'X' not found"` for any request because the dispatcher always stripped a stage prefix from the URL. Stage resolution now checks the API's configured stages: strip the first segment only if it matches a real stage, otherwise route to `$default` with the full path (matching AWS). Same fix applies to the WebSocket scope handler. Reported by @whittin3. Fixes #404
- **API Gateway v2 HTTP API — `corsConfiguration` ignored** — every OPTIONS preflight returned a hard-coded wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, breaking browsers using `credentials: "include"`, and non-OPTIONS responses had the wildcard spliced in over whatever the Lambda set. API Gateway now serves preflights from the per-API `corsConfiguration` (403 if origin isn't in `allowOrigins`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` only when configured and paired with a concrete origin), and dispatched responses carry per-config CORS headers instead of the wildcard. Reported by @whittin3. Fixes #406
- **Lambda alias qualifier parsed as function name** — integrations (v1 REST, v2 HTTP, v2 WebSocket) and event source mappings wired to a qualified ARN (`arn:...:function:<name>:<alias>`) invoked a function whose name was the qualifier (`live`) and returned `502 "Lambda function 'live' not found"`. All three dispatchers now use `_resolve_name_and_qualifier` + `_get_func_record_for_qualifier` to resolve aliases to their target version before invocation; worker pool keyed by `name:qualifier` so aliased vs unqualified calls don't share process state. ESM pollers (SQS, Kinesis, DDB Streams) store the qualifier on the mapping and use it on every batch. Reported by @whittin3. Fixes #407
- **API Gateway v1 error responses used `type` instead of `__type`** — boto3 fell back to the numeric HTTP status as the error code (`ClientError.response["Error"]["Code"] == "409"` instead of `"ConflictException"`). Every JSON-protocol AWS service uses `__type`; v1 now matches.
- **SQS singular `DeleteMessage` / `ChangeMessageVisibility` silently succeeded on invalid ReceiptHandle** — real AWS returns `ReceiptHandleIsInvalid` (400); batch variants already did. Singular operations now raise the same error. Contributed by @nigel-campbell (#405)

## [1.3.5] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **API Gateway v2 WebSocket APIs** — full WebSocket support on the execute-api host: `CreateApi(ProtocolType=WEBSOCKET)`, `RouteResponse` + `IntegrationResponse` CRUD, `$connect`/`$disconnect`/`$default`/custom-action route dispatch via `$request.body.*`, `AWS_PROXY`/`AWS`/`MOCK` integrations, and the `@connections` management API (`PostToConnection`/`GetConnection`/`DeleteConnection`) with per-connection outbox for server-side push. `$connect` receives `queryStringParameters`/`multiValueQueryStringParameters` so token-gated hooks work like AWS. Multi-tenant: connections carry their owning account. Reported by @whittin3. Fixes #383
- **Resource Groups Tagging API — Phase 3** — `TagResources` and `UntagResources` across S3, Lambda, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, EventBridge, KMS, ECR, ECS, Glue, Cognito (IdP + Identity), AppSync, Scheduler, CloudFront, EFS. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#384). Fixes #382

### Changed
- **Centralised service registry** — `SERVICE_HANDLERS`, `SERVICE_NAME_ALIASES`, and `_reset_all_state`'s module list are now derived from one `SERVICE_REGISTRY` in `app.py`. Adding a service is one dict entry. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#391)
- **ASGI dispatcher refactor** — the monolithic `app()` is split into tiered helpers (pre-body / post-body / special data-plane / generic). Adds an `_is_potential_alb_request()` gate that skips the ALB module load for non-ALB traffic. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#394)

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation `AWS::Region` and provisioner ARNs ignored the caller's region** — CFN used a module-level `REGION` everywhere, so CDK bootstrap with `AWS_REGION=us-east-2` got `us-east-1` baked into every `${AWS::Region}` substitution and ~15 provisioner ARNs. Region is now a per-request contextvar (`get_region()`); CFN engine, handlers, and every provisioner use it. Reported by @youngkwangk. Fixes #398
- **S3 `CompleteMultipartUpload` did not version the final object** — when versioning was enabled, the response lacked `x-amz-version-id` and the object never appeared in `list_object_versions`. Multipart now follows the same versioning path as `PutObject`. Reported by @adzcodemi. (#397) Fixes #392
- **EC2 `CreateSecurityGroup` description parameter** — contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#396)
- **Tagging `TagResources`/`UntagResources` error shape** — unsupported resource types and missing resources now return `InvalidParameterException` (400) in `FailedResourcesMap`, matching AWS. Previously returned `InternalServiceException` (501/500) or silently no-op'd on Lambda/SNS/SQS/Cognito-IDP. Writers/removers now raise a typed `_ResourceNotFound` that the entry point surfaces per-ARN. Docstrings added across every writer/remover.

---

## [1.3.4] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **`Expect: 100-continue` regression on boto3 < 1.40 (S3 `upload_file`)** — after the uvicorn → hypercorn migration in 1.3.0 (#369), boto3 `< 1.40` S3 uploads that used the `Expect: 100-continue` handshake aborted with `urllib3 BadStatusLine('date: ...')`. Root cause: h11 serialises `InformationalResponse` with an empty reason phrase by default, producing `HTTP/1.1 100 \r\n` on the wire, which older urllib3 parses strictly. ministack now installs a surgical compatibility shim at app import (`ministack.core.hypercorn_compat`) that injects the canonical reason phrase (`Continue`, `Switching Protocols`, etc.) when h11 emits an empty one, restoring the pre-1.3.0 behaviour for every SDK version. Reported by @AlbertodelaCruz. Fixes #389

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Lambda → CloudWatch Logs emission** — every invocation now writes to `/aws/lambda/{FunctionName}` (auto-created) on a per-invocation stream `{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/[{qualifier}]{uuid}` with AWS-shaped `START RequestId:` / handler stdout+stderr / `END RequestId:` / `REPORT RequestId: … Duration: N ms Billed Duration: N ms Memory Size: N MB` lines. Unlocks Metric Filter / subscription filter / alarm testing chains that were previously impossible locally. Applies to every executor (Docker RIE, warm worker, provided-runtime, local subprocess).
- **`LAMBDA_STRICT=1` env var** — AWS-fidelity mode: every Lambda invocation runs in Docker via the AWS RIE image; in-process fallbacks are disabled. Missing Docker surfaces as `Runtime.DockerUnavailable` instead of silently degrading to a subprocess. Opt-in; default behaviour keeps the no-Docker-required install path working.
- **`LAMBDA_WARM_TTL_SECONDS` env var** — tunable idle TTL (default 300s) before the reaper thread evicts warm Docker containers from the pool.
- **`LAMBDA_ACCOUNT_CONCURRENCY` env var** — account-level concurrent-invocation cap (default 0 = unbounded). Set to 1000 to match real AWS's default account limit and exercise `ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded` throttle paths.
- **Async retry + DLQ / `DestinationConfig.OnFailure` routing** — `Invoke(InvocationType=Event)` and every internal event-source fan-out (currently: S3 notifications) now retry up to `MaximumRetryAttempts` (default 2) on failure and route the final failure to the configured DLQ (`DeadLetterConfig.TargetArn`) or `OnFailure` destination (SQS / SNS / Lambda), with an AWS-shaped envelope (`requestContext`, `requestPayload`, `responseContext`, `responsePayload`). Shared `invoke_async_with_retry` helper keeps direct async Invoke and event-source invocations on the same semantics.
- **`X-Amz-Function-Error: Handled` vs `Unhandled` distinction** — `_invoke_rie` now reads RIE's `Lambda-Runtime-Function-Error-Type` response header to classify raised-exception errors (`Unhandled`) separately from handler-returned error payloads (`Handled`), matching real AWS. The classification is surfaced in the Invoke response header.
- **`Retry-After` HTTP header on 429 throttle responses** — `TooManyRequestsException` responses now include both a `retryAfterSeconds` body field and a `Retry-After` HTTP header, matching AWS.

### Changed
- **Lambda Docker executor — unified Zip/Image pool** — restores the intent of @fzonneveld's #302: Zip and Image package types now share a single code path through the RIE warm pool (`_execute_function_image` is gone). The pool is a list-per-key (`{account}:{fn}:{zip|image}:{sha|uri}`) so concurrent invocations get separate containers, up to `ReservedConcurrentExecutions` (unbounded by default, matching AWS). Thread-safe under `_warm_pool_lock`. `reset()` kills every pooled container across all accounts. A background reaper evicts idle containers past TTL. **Regression fix from 1.2.20** — the post-merge commits on that release had split the paths back apart and reintroduced per-invocation cold starts for Image type. Originally contributed by @fzonneveld (#302).

### Fixed
- **Lambda Docker executor — Image type was cold-starting per invoke** — `_execute_function_image` created a fresh container, invoked, then killed it. Image functions now share the same warm pool as Zip.
- **Lambda Docker executor — warm cache was single-container per key** — concurrent invocations of the same function either serialised or created cold starts. The pool is now a list so up to `ReservedConcurrentExecutions` invocations run in parallel from the pool.
- **Lambda Docker executor — `CodeSha256` missing for Image package type** — cache key was empty for Image-type, meaning different Image-type functions could collide. Cache key is now derived from `ImageUri` for Image and `CodeSha256` for Zip, per-account.

### Removed
- **`ministack/core/lambda_wrapper.py` and `ministack/core/lambda_wrapper_node.js`** — dead code since the RIE-image migration. The AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator provides the full runtime contract (handler loading, stdin/stdout, LambdaContext, boto3); the hand-rolled wrappers were never referenced after #302 landed. Removed.

### Multi-tenancy correctness (8 CRITICAL cross-account leaks closed)

These services stored per-tenant data in plain `dict` / `list`, so `List*` / `Describe*` operations leaked rows across accounts. All now use `AccountScopedDict`. Cross-account isolation tests added to `tests/test_multitenancy.py` to lock in each fix.

- **CloudWatch metrics + alarm history** — `_metrics` and `_alarm_history` were global. Tenant A's `PutMetricData` was visible to Tenant B's `ListMetrics` / `GetMetricStatistics` / `DescribeAlarmHistory`.
- **ElastiCache events** — `_events` list was global. `DescribeEvents` returned all tenants' cache events. Also missing `_tags.clear()` from `reset()`.
- **EventBridge** — `_event_buses`, `_events_log`, `_partner_event_sources` were all global. Tenants shared the same "default" event bus (with an ARN baked at module-load with whichever account first imported the module). The "default" bus is now seeded lazily per-tenant on first request so its ARN always matches the caller's account id.
- **Athena workgroups + data catalogs** — `_workgroups` and `_data_catalogs` were global. Creating a workgroup named `my-wg` in Tenant A prevented Tenant B from creating one. The default `primary` workgroup and `AwsDataCatalog` are now seeded lazily per-tenant.
- **SES sent emails** — `_sent_emails` list was global. `GetSendStatistics` aggregated across tenants.
- **API Gateway v1** — `_stages_v1`, `_deployments_v1`, `_authorizers_v1`, `_v1_tags` were all plain dicts. REST API stages / deployments / authorizers / tags leaked across tenants. **New finding in this audit** — APIGW v1 was not covered by earlier multi-tenancy reviews.

### Lambda fixes

- **Kinesis ESM `FilterCriteria` fallback — `NameError: name 'new_iter' is not defined`** — when all records in a Kinesis batch were filtered out, the poller tried to advance the shard position using an undefined local, crashing the poller thread silently. Now advances by `pos + len(raw_records)` (the full consumed batch) matching the success-path semantics.

### AWS API parity
- **Lambda `State` / `LastUpdateStatus` transitions** — `CreateFunction`, `UpdateFunctionCode`, and `UpdateFunctionConfiguration` now return `State: "Pending"` + `LastUpdateStatus: "InProgress"` initially, transitioning to `Active` / `Successful` asynchronously. Terraform's `FunctionActive` and `FunctionUpdated` waiters now poll successfully instead of racing. Transition delay is tunable via `LAMBDA_STATE_TRANSITION_SECONDS` (default `0.5s`).
- **Lambda `GetAccountSettings`** — new handler at `GET /2016-08-19/account-settings`, returns `AccountLimit` (`TotalCodeSize`, `CodeSizeUnzipped`, `CodeSizeZipped`, `ConcurrentExecutions`, `UnreservedConcurrentExecutions`) and `AccountUsage` (`TotalCodeSize`, `FunctionCount`). Matches AWS response shape so Terraform data sources and CI tooling that probe the account-level limits work.
- **Lambda async retry exponential backoff** — `invoke_async_with_retry` now sleeps between attempts (base `1s`, exponential, capped at `30s` locally — tunable via `LAMBDA_ASYNC_RETRY_BASE_SECONDS` / `LAMBDA_ASYNC_RETRY_MAX_SECONDS`), and respects `MaximumEventAgeInSeconds` so a retry that would push past the event age is skipped and routed to DLQ. AWS uses 1-minute base; scaled down locally to keep tests fast while preserving the shape.
- **Lambda `InvokeWithResponseStream` — real vnd.amazon.eventstream framing** — responses are now emitted as a valid `PayloadChunk` + `InvokeComplete` sequence with correct prelude CRC + message CRC. boto3's `EventStream` parser decodes them natively. Handler errors flip to the `InvokeError` event type with a JSON error body.
- **Lambda `GetFunction.Code.Location` — pre-signed-style URL** — `GetFunction` now returns a URL pointing at a new `/_ministack/lambda-code/{fn}` endpoint, dressed with `X-Amz-Algorithm`, `X-Amz-Expires=600`, `X-Amz-Date`, `X-Amz-SignedHeaders`, `X-Amz-Signature` query params so AWS SDKs and `pip`-style pull-and-extract scripts work against it unchanged. For `PackageType=Image`, `ResolvedImageUri` is now populated (echo of `ImageUri`) alongside `ImageUri`.
- **Lambda `ListFunctionEventInvokeConfigs`** — new handler at `GET /2019-09-25/functions/{name}/event-invoke-config/list`. Returns the stored event-invoke config (one entry) or an empty list.
- **Lambda `GetFunctionCodeSigningConfig` / `PutFunctionCodeSigningConfig` / `DeleteFunctionCodeSigningConfig`** — real shape: GET returns `{FunctionName, CodeSigningConfigArn}`, PUT stores the ARN on the function, DELETE clears it. Was a stub returning empty fields.
- **Lambda REPORT log line — real `Max Memory Used`** — previously hardcoded `0 MB`. When the docker executor is used, peak RSS is now read from `container.stats()`; on non-docker executors it falls back to `resource.getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN).ru_maxrss` (Linux/macOS normalised). Warm-worker subprocesses that never terminate still report `0 MB` — that matches "we don't have it" and avoids inventing a number.
- **Lambda ESM `FilterCriteria` applied during polling** — SQS / Kinesis / DynamoDB Streams pollers now evaluate each record against the ESM's `FilterCriteria.Filters` patterns and drop non-matching records before invoking the handler, matching AWS. Supports equality lists, `prefix`, `suffix`, `anything-but`, `exists`, and `numeric` content filters; SQS bodies are JSON-parsed for matching so patterns like `{"body": {"orderType": ["Premium"]}}` work as documented.
- **Lambda runtime image map — `java25`, `dotnet10`** — added to `_RUNTIME_IMAGE_MAP`, pointing at `public.ecr.aws/lambda/java:25` and `public.ecr.aws/lambda/dotnet:10`. Matches AWS's April 2026 runtime additions.
- **Lambda `DurableConfig` / `TenancyConfig` / `CapacityProviderConfig`** — new 2026-era optional config blocks are accepted on `CreateFunction` / `UpdateFunctionConfiguration`, stored, and echoed on `GetFunction` / `GetFunctionConfiguration`. Only emitted when set, matching AWS's response shape.

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Resource Groups Tagging API — Phase 1** — new service at credential scope `tagging` / target prefix `ResourceGroupsTaggingAPI_20170126`. `GetResources` with `TagFilters` (AND across keys, OR across values) and `ResourceTypeFilters` across S3, Lambda, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, EventBridge. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#372). Fixes #371
- **Resource Groups Tagging API — Phase 2** — `GetTagKeys` and `GetTagValues` operations, plus GetResources expanded to KMS, ECR, ECS, Glue, Cognito (User Pools + Identity Pools), AppSync, Scheduler, CloudFront, EFS (file systems + access points). 15 services total, 18 new tests. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#380). Fixes #379
- **CloudFormation `AWS::Pipes::Pipe` provisioner** — minimal EventBridge Pipes runtime covering DynamoDB Streams → SNS with background polling; `CreationTime`, `CurrentState`, and ARN exposed via `Fn::GetAtt`. Also adds `FilterPolicy` / `FilterPolicyScope` support to the `AWS::SNS::Subscription` provisioner. Contributed by @davidtme (#354)
- **RDS `ModifyDBInstance` MasterUserPassword rotation** — password changes are now propagated to the real Postgres/MySQL Docker container via `ALTER USER`, so follow-up connections from application code authenticate with the new password. Contributed by @ptanlam (#376)
- **Preview Docker image on every PR (including forks)** — `docker-publish-on-pr.yml` switched to `pull_request_target` and now publishes `ministackorg/ministack-preview-build:pr-N-<shortsha>` for any contributor's PR. Reviewers can `docker pull` the exact build without waiting for merge. Workflow runs against main's copy of the file, so a PR's own edits to `.github/workflows/*` cannot redirect the publish. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#377)

### Fixed
- **Resource Groups Tagging — `ResourceTypeFilters` with no matching collector** — previously fell through to every collector (asking for EC2 returned S3/SQS/SNS/etc.). Now correctly returns an empty list, matching AWS.
- **Resource Groups Tagging — CloudFormation-provisioned DynamoDB tables** — tags set via `AWS::DynamoDB::Table { Tags: [...] }` are stored on the table record, not in the central `_tags` dict, so they were invisible to `GetResources`. The DynamoDB collector now unions both sources.
- **EventBridge Pipes `CreationTime`** — stored as `int(time.time())` instead of `time.time()`, matching the project-wide int-epoch convention for JSON responses (Java SDK v2 compatibility).
- **RDS `_rotate_instance_password` — SQL injection via unquoted username** — the Postgres path used `psycopg2.extensions.AsIs` to splice `MasterUsername` into an `ALTER USER` statement, bypassing quoting. Replaced with `psycopg2.sql.Identifier` for safe identifier quoting.
- **RDS `_rotate_instance_password` — silent failure visibility** — rotation failures (unreachable container, stale old password) now log at `ERROR` rather than `WARNING` so operators notice when the stored master password diverges from the real DB.

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Hypercorn ASGI server with HTTP/2 h2c** — replaces uvicorn with hypercorn, enabling cleartext HTTP/2 (h2c) support. AWS Java SDK v2 and Kinesis Client Library (KCL) clients that require HTTP/2 now work out of the box. Idle RAM drops from ~21 MB to ~7 MB. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#369). Fixes #361, #364
- **Lambda log forwarding for Winston/pino** — replaces 5 individual `console.*` overrides with a single `process.stdout.write` intercept. Catches logging libraries like Winston and pino that write directly to `stdout.write` instead of `console.log`. Contributed by @Baptiste-Garcin (#373)
- **Test suite** — 121 new tests across 11 services: AutoScaling (37 new), ElastiCache (15 new), Glue (19 new), RDS (14 new), CloudWatch Logs (7 new), EMR (5 new), EFS (5 new), Cloud Map (5 new), ACM (3 new), CloudWatch (2 new), EBS (2 new). Total test count: 1,558

### Fixed
- **Glue `GetPartitionIndexes` Keys format** — service returned Keys as flat strings (`["year"]`) instead of KeySchemaElement objects (`[{"Name": "year"}]`), causing boto3 deserialization failures
- **RDS `LatestRestorableTime` empty timestamp** — `DescribeDBInstances` rendered `<LatestRestorableTime></LatestRestorableTime>` (empty string) which boto3 couldn't parse as a timestamp. Now defaults to current time
- **EKS graceful fallback when k3s fails** — if Docker is unavailable or k3s container fails to start (e.g. privileged containers blocked), `CreateCluster` now returns ACTIVE with a mock endpoint and CA certificate instead of FAILED. The EKS API works identically regardless of Docker availability; real k3s is used when possible
- **EKS state persistence** — restored clusters stay ACTIVE instead of being marked FAILED on restart
- **EKS Docker tests flaky in parallel** — k3s containers interfere with each other under pytest-xdist. Added both EKS Docker tests to `_SERIAL_TESTS`
- **EKS CFN test CI failure** — k3s can't start on CI (no Docker), cluster stays in CREATING. Test now polls and accepts CREATING status

### Changed
- **ASGI server: uvicorn → hypercorn** — dependency changed from `uvicorn[standard]` + `httptools` to `hypercorn>=0.18.0`
- **pytest parallel distribution: `--dist=load` → `--dist=loadfile`** — keeps all tests from the same file on the same worker, fixing pre-existing Lambda/IAM ordering failures caused by shared session fixtures

---

## [1.2.21] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`/_ministack/ready` endpoint** — exposes ready.d script completion status, enabling Docker healthchecks and orchestrators to gate on init script completion. Contributed by @kjdev (#360)
- **ECS `command` passed to Docker containers** — task definition `containerDefinitions[].command` is now forwarded to `docker run`, overriding the image's default CMD. Previously the command field was ignored. Contributed by @s0rbus (#366)
- **CloudFormation `AWS::Events::EventBus` provisioner** — CDK/Terraform stacks declaring EventBridge custom event buses now provision correctly. Supports Name, Tags, and Fn::GetAtt Arn/Name. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#365)
- **Lambda Java, .NET, and Ruby runtime support** — `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker` now supports `java21`, `java17`, `java11`, `java8.al2`, `dotnet8`, `dotnet6`, `ruby3.4`, `ruby3.3`, `ruby3.2` using official AWS Lambda RIE images. Fallback resolvers added for future versions.

### Fixed

#### Lambda
- **Lambda Docker-in-Docker (DinD)** — `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker` now works when ministack itself runs inside Docker. Code is copied into Lambda containers via `docker cp` instead of bind mounts (which fail because the host Docker daemon can't see the ministack container's filesystem). Lambda containers are reached via container IP instead of host-mapped ports. Container detection uses `/.dockerenv`, `/run/.containerenv`, and `/proc/1/cgroup` fallback. Fixes #367. Reported by @HackJack-101
- **Lambda timeout enforcement** — warm workers now enforce the configured `Timeout` value via `thread.join(timeout)` + `proc.kill()`. Previously, functions ran indefinitely regardless of the timeout setting. Timeout errors return `Runtime.ExitError` matching AWS behavior.
- **Lambda published version isolation** — `PublishVersion` now creates immutable code snapshots. Invoking a specific version returns the code from when it was published, not the current `$LATEST`. Workers are keyed by `function_name:qualifier` to prevent version cross-contamination.
- **Lambda `UpdateFunctionCode` worker invalidation** — only invalidates the `$LATEST` worker, leaving published version workers alive. Previously killed all workers for the function.
- **Lambda warm container tmpdir cleanup** — warm container cache now tracks and cleans up temp directories when containers are evicted or on `reset()`. Previously leaked `/tmp/ministack-lambda-docker-*` directories.
- **Lambda `_execute_function_image` deduplicated** — Image-based Lambda execution now reuses `_invoke_rie()` instead of duplicating the HTTP polling logic.
- **Lambda `_invoke_rie` faster polling** — reduced polling interval from 500ms to 100ms for faster cold starts when using `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker`.
- **Lambda `Invoke` qualifier from query params** — `Qualifier` query parameter now correctly parsed for Lambda invocations, matching AWS SDK behavior.
- **Lambda worker error on exception** — worker invalidation on exception now only kills the specific qualifier's worker, not all workers for the function.

#### Cognito
- **Cognito password validation** — `SignUp`, `AdminCreateUser`, `AdminSetUserPassword`, `ConfirmForgotPassword`, and `ChangePassword` now validate passwords against the pool's `PasswordPolicy` (min length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). Previously any password was accepted.
- **Cognito `_generate_temp_password` policy-compliant** — generated temporary passwords now guarantee at least one character from each required class (upper, lower, digit, symbol), ensuring they pass the pool's own password policy.

#### EKS
- **EKS non-blocking cluster creation** — `CreateCluster` now returns immediately with `status: CREATING` while k3s starts in a background thread. Previously blocked the ASGI event loop for up to 30 seconds.
- **EKS failure status** — if k3s fails to start, the cluster status is set to `FAILED` instead of silently going `ACTIVE` with a broken endpoint.
- **EKS k3s image pinned** — default k3s image pinned to `rancher/k3s:v1.31.4-k3s1` instead of `:latest` for reproducible builds.

#### Performance & Infrastructure
- **Docker client cached** — Lambda Docker executor reuses a single Docker client instead of creating one per invocation.
- **EC2 terminated instance cleanup throttled** — `DescribeInstances` no longer scans and cleans up terminated instances on every call; cleanup runs at most once per 10 seconds.
- **S3 ETag single-compute** — `PutObject` now computes the MD5 hash once instead of twice, reducing CPU per write.
- **CloudFormation deploy/delete speed** — removed artificial 1.5s async delays from stack deploy and delete operations.
- **`/_ministack/reset` no longer blocks event loop** — `_reset_all_state()` now runs via `asyncio.to_thread()` so Docker container cleanup (ECS, EKS, Lambda) doesn't starve the ASGI event loop. ECS `reset()` also fixed to stop containers by label filter (`ministack=ecs`) instead of individually fetching stale container IDs.

---

## [1.2.20] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **EKS service with k3s backend** — CreateCluster, DescribeCluster, ListClusters, DeleteCluster, CreateNodegroup, DescribeNodegroup, ListNodegroups, DeleteNodegroup, TagResource, UntagResource, ListTagsForResource. `CreateCluster` spawns a real k3s Docker container (75 MB) providing a full Kubernetes API server. `kubectl`, Helm, and any K8s tooling work out of the box. Cascading delete removes nodegroups and k3s container. CloudFormation `AWS::EKS::Cluster` and `AWS::EKS::Nodegroup` provisioners included.
- **Lambda layer S3 support** — `PublishLayerVersion` now accepts `S3Bucket`/`S3Key` in Content, matching real AWS behavior. Contributed by @Baptiste-Garcin (#356)
- **Lambda Docker executor rewritten with AWS RIE** — `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker` now uses official AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator images (`public.ecr.aws/lambda/*`) for all runtimes (Python, Node.js, provided). Events are POSTed to the RIE HTTP endpoint on port 8080, matching exact AWS Lambda execution semantics. Containers are kept warm between invocations and reused when the same function+code is invoked again. Cleaned up on `reset()` and shutdown. Added `nodejs22.x`, `nodejs24.x`, `python3.14` runtimes. Contributed by @fzonneveld (#302)
- **Lambda Windows compatibility** — replaced `select.select()` stderr polling with cross-platform background thread + queue. Fixes Lambda warm worker execution on Windows. Contributed by @davidtme (#350)
- **Lambda ESM poller on CFN create and state restore** — event source mappings created via CloudFormation or restored from persisted state now correctly start the background poller. Contributed by @davidtme (#350)

### Fixed

#### AWS Compliance (21 fixes from full-codebase audit)
- **KMS `Verify` error handling** — invalid signatures now raise `KMSInvalidSignatureException` (HTTP 400) instead of returning `SignatureValid: false` with HTTP 200, matching real AWS behavior.
- **KMS `Decrypt`/`GenerateDataKey`/`Sign`/`Verify`/`Encrypt` response `KeyId`** — all KMS crypto operations now return the full key ARN in the `KeyId` field instead of the bare UUID, matching real AWS.
- **KMS `PendingDeletion` state check** — `Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, `Sign`, `Verify`, and `GenerateDataKey` now return `KMSInvalidStateException` when called on a key scheduled for deletion or disabled. Previously these operations silently succeeded.
- **EC2 `TerminateInstances`/`StopInstances`/`StartInstances` unknown instance IDs** — now return `InvalidInstanceID.NotFound` error instead of silently succeeding with an empty response.
- **EC2 VPC `cidrBlockAssociationSet` missing** — `CreateVpc` and `DescribeVpcs` responses now include `<cidrBlockAssociationSet>` with the primary CIDR association. Fixes Terraform AWS provider v6 crash (`index out of range [0]`). Reported by @mspiller (#331)
- **SQS FIFO `DeduplicationScope: messageGroup`** — content-based deduplication now correctly scopes per message group when `DeduplicationScope` is `messageGroup`. Previously, two messages with the same body but different `MessageGroupId` values were incorrectly deduplicated. Contributed by @CSandyHub (#359)
- **SNS `ListSubscriptions` XML escaping** — endpoint URLs containing `&` or other XML special characters are now properly escaped, preventing malformed XML responses.
- **DynamoDB `DescribeTable` `LatestStreamArn` stability** — stream ARN and label are now set once when `StreamSpecification` is enabled instead of regenerated on every `DescribeTable` call. Fixes CDK drift detection and ESM setup failures.
- **SSM `GetParametersByPath` root path** — `GetParametersByPath` with `Path=/` and `Recursive=false` now correctly returns only top-level parameters instead of all parameters in the store.
- **ElastiCache `AutomaticFailover`/`MultiAZ` values** — `CreateReplicationGroup` and `ModifyReplicationGroup` now return `enabled`/`disabled` enum values instead of raw `true`/`false` strings, matching the AWS API contract.
- **Transfer Family pagination off-by-one** — `ListServers` and `ListUsers` no longer re-serve the token item when paginating, fixing duplicate entries across pages.
- **ECS `PutAccountSettingDefault` inconsistency** — now stores a plain string value like `PutAccountSetting`, fixing `ListAccountSettings` response shape when both endpoints were used.
- **IAM user inline policy persistence** — restructured `_user_inline_policies` from tuple keys `(user, policy)` to nested dict `{user: {policy: doc}}`. Tuple keys silently broke JSON serialization, causing all user inline policies to be lost on restart with `PERSIST_STATE=1`.
- **Route53 `reset()` multi-tenancy** — `reset()` now calls `.clear()` on existing `AccountScopedDict` instances instead of replacing them with plain `dict` objects, preserving multi-tenant isolation after reset.
- **STS `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` provider** — `Provider` field now uses the caller-supplied `ProviderId` instead of hardcoded `accounts.google.com`.
- **EKS state persistence** — `get_state()` now saves `port_counter` and strips Docker container IDs. `restore_state()` restores port counter and marks clusters as `FAILED` (k3s containers don't survive restart).

#### Architecture & Safety
- **Persistence `eval()` replaced with `ast.literal_eval`** — deserialization of `AccountScopedDict` keys no longer uses `eval()`, closing a code injection vector via crafted state files.
- **RDS `_wait_for_port` no longer blocks event loop** — container port wait now runs in a background thread. Previously a `CreateDBInstance` with Docker could block the entire ASGI server for up to 60 seconds.
- **RDS `get_state()` multi-account persistence** — `get_state()` now serializes instances as a full `AccountScopedDict`, capturing all accounts instead of only the default account at shutdown time.
- **RDS `_port_counter` thread safety** — port allocation now uses a `threading.Lock`, preventing potential duplicate ports under concurrent requests.
- **Lambda ESM poller account context** — background SQS/Kinesis/DynamoDB Streams pollers now iterate `_esms._data` directly and set the correct account context per ESM. Previously, event source mappings created under non-default accounts were silently never polled.

### Also Fixed
- **EC2 SecurityGroup duplicate detection ignoring Description** — `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` duplicate check and `RevokeSecurityGroupIngress` now compare rules without the `Description` field, matching AWS behavior.
- **CloudWatch DeleteDashboards error** — deleting a nonexistent dashboard returned 500 InternalError instead of 404 DashboardNotFoundError.
- **Athena ListNamedQueries empty** — `ListNamedQueries` without a `WorkGroup` filter now returns all queries instead of only "primary" workgroup.
- **ElastiCache CreateCacheSubnetGroup missing Subnets** — response XML now includes `<Subnets>` element.
- **Cognito OAuth2 lazy loading** — OAuth2 endpoints now use lazy module loading, fixing crash when Cognito module wasn't pre-imported.
- **Cognito OAuth2 persistence** — `_authorization_codes` and `_refresh_tokens` now included in state persistence.
- **Lambda warm worker stuck after init failure** — broken workers are now invalidated so the next invocation gets a fresh process. Reported by @Baptiste-Garcin
- **Docker image missing `boto3`** — Lambda functions importing `boto3` now work out of the box. Real AWS Lambda runtimes pre-install `boto3`; the Docker image only had `botocore` (via `awscli`). Reported by @xPTM1219 (#362)

---

## [1.2.19] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- **EventBridge Scheduler service** — full `scheduler` API: CreateSchedule, GetSchedule, UpdateSchedule, DeleteSchedule, ListSchedules, CreateScheduleGroup, GetScheduleGroup, DeleteScheduleGroup, ListScheduleGroups, TagResource, UntagResource, ListTagsForResource. Supports schedule groups, cascading deletes, name prefix/state filters, and `at()`/`cron()`/`rate()` expressions. 21 tests.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::Scheduler::Schedule` and `AWS::Scheduler::ScheduleGroup`** — CFN/CDK stacks using EventBridge Scheduler resources now provision correctly and are queryable via the Scheduler API.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::CodeBuild::Project`** — CDK/Terraform stacks declaring CodeBuild projects now provision correctly. Supports Name, Source, Artifacts, Environment, ServiceRole, Tags, and Fn::GetAtt Arn. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#352)
- **Cognito OAuth2/OIDC managed login UI** — `/oauth2/authorize` serves a browser-based login form, `/oauth2/token` supports authorization_code (with PKCE S256/plain), refresh_token, and client_credentials grants, `/oauth2/userInfo` returns OIDC claims, `/logout` redirects to logout URI. Full hosted UI flow for local development. Contributed by @kjdev (#344)
- **ECS `ListContainerInstances` and `DescribeContainerInstances`** — stub endpoints return empty results (MiniStack runs tasks directly as Docker containers, no EC2 container instance layer).

### Fixed
- **DynamoDB CFN StreamSpecification** — CloudFormation DynamoDB tables with `StreamViewType` but no explicit `StreamEnabled` now correctly enable streams. `Fn::GetAtt StreamArn` returns a valid stream ARN. Contributed by @davidtme (#349)
- **IAM/STS split** — IAM and STS are now separate modules (`iam.py` and `sts.py`), each with standard `handle_request`. Eliminates the `func_name` parameter hack in the lazy loader.
- **IAM user inline policy persistence** — `PutUserPolicy` data was not included in `get_state()`/`restore_state()`, causing inline policies to be lost on restart with `PERSIST_STATE=1`.
- **AutoScaling state persistence** — added `get_state()`, `restore_state()`, and `reset()` to autoscaling service. ASG, launch config, policy, hook, scheduled action, and tag state is now persisted and reset correctly.
- **Health endpoint version** — `/_ministack/health` now returns the real package version instead of hardcoded `3.0.0.dev`.

### Improved
- **Lazy service imports** — service modules are now loaded on first request instead of at startup. Idle RAM drops from ~59 MB to ~21 MB (64% reduction). Startup time drops from ~1.2s to ~0.5s (2.5x faster). Services that are never called consume zero memory.
- **Removed pip from Docker image** — pip is no longer present in the final image (security hardening, reduced attack surface).

---

## [1.2.18] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **ECS services/tasks invisible when created via CloudFormation** — CF provisioner stored services with ARN keys instead of `cluster/name`, causing `list-services` and `list-tasks` to return empty. Fixed key format, added task spawning on service create/update/delete, and replaced stale tasks on task definition updates. CF provisioner now delegates to the ECS module for a single code path. Reported by @Vagator-Prostovich
- **ECS CF container definitions PascalCase mismatch** — CloudFormation container definitions used PascalCase keys (`Name`, `Image`, `PortMappings`) but the ECS runtime expected camelCase, causing `KeyError` when spawning tasks. Added `_normalize_container_defs` to convert keys.
- **ECS `_task_def_latest` stored string instead of integer** — CF provisioner stored `"family:1"` instead of `1`, producing malformed keys like `"family:family:1"` on subsequent registrations.
- **ECS CF task definition and service delete used wrong keys** — delete handlers used ARN but dicts were keyed by `family:revision` and `cluster/name` respectively.

---

## [1.2.17] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Transfer Family service** — new service with 10 operations: CreateServer, DescribeServer, DeleteServer, ListServers, CreateUser, DescribeUser, DeleteUser, ListUsers, ImportSshPublicKey, DeleteSshPublicKey. SFTP server/user management with SSH key rotation and LOGICAL home directory mappings to S3. Contributed by @mjdavidson (#330)

### Fixed
- **Cognito `cognito:groups` missing from tokens** — `initiate_auth` and `admin_initiate_auth` now include the `cognito:groups` claim in both access and ID tokens when the user belongs to one or more groups. Contributed by @subrotosanyal (#342)
- **Cognito AccessToken missing `scope` claim** — AccessToken now includes `scope: "aws.cognito.signin.user.admin"`, matching real AWS Cognito. Libraries validating OAuth2 scopes no longer fail.
- **Lambda default runtime updated to python3.12** — AWS blocked new `python3.9` function creation since Dec 15 2025. All defaults and tests updated. Zip deployments without `Runtime` now return `InvalidParameterValueException`. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#339)
- **Ready.d scripts use `MINISTACK_HOST`** — `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` in init scripts now uses `MINISTACK_HOST` instead of hardcoded `localhost`. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#339)
- **Docker Compose version field removed** — silences Compose v2 deprecation warning. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#339)
- **Ruff target-version corrected** — reverted to `py310` to match `requires-python = ">=3.10"`.

---

## [1.2.16] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- **KMS ECC key support** — `CreateKey` now supports `ECC_SECG_P256K1`, `ECC_NIST_P256`, `ECC_NIST_P384`, and `ECC_NIST_P521` key specs with `ECDSA_SHA_256`, `ECDSA_SHA_384`, `ECDSA_SHA_512` signing algorithms. Sign/Verify works for both `RAW` and `DIGEST` message types. `GetPublicKey` returns DER-encoded EC public keys. Contributed by @dvrkn (#335)

### Fixed
- **Lambda endpoint URL override** — function-level `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` environment variables no longer override MiniStack's internal endpoint. When MiniStack runs in Docker with a host-port that differs from the container port (e.g., `4568:4566`), Lambda functions would receive the host-mapped URL which is unreachable from inside the container, causing SDK callbacks to fail with "connection refused". Fix applies to all executor paths: provided runtime, Docker mode, image mode, and warm workers. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#336)
- **SFN callback/activity timeout not scaled** — `SFN_WAIT_SCALE=0` no longer causes `States.Timeout` on activity tasks and `waitForTaskToken` callbacks. The scale factor was incorrectly applied to functional timeouts (which must wait for real work to complete), not just Wait state sleeps and retry intervals. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#337)
- **Init scripts override mounted AWS credentials** — ready.d scripts no longer set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test` when the user has mounted `~/.aws/credentials` into the container. The AWS CLI credential chain (env vars > credentials file) meant our defaults stomped on the user's configured profile. Now checks for credentials files at `~/.aws/credentials`, `/root/.aws/credentials`, and `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`. Reported by @staranto

---

## [1.2.15] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Kinesis `GetRecords` iterator handling** — shard iterators are no longer consumed (popped) on use, matching real AWS behavior where iterators remain valid until their 5-minute TTL expires. Previously, calling `GetRecords` immediately invalidated the iterator, causing `ExpiredIteratorException` on client retries. Polling consumers like Apache Camel that retry on transient failures would fail with "Iterator has expired or is invalid". Reported by @markwimpory

---

## [1.2.14] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Cognito federated SAML/OIDC auth flow** — `GET /oauth2/authorize` (redirects to external SAML/OIDC IdP), `POST /saml2/idpresponse` (parses SAML assertion, creates federated user, issues authorization code), and `POST /oauth2/token` now supports `grant_type=authorization_code` for full SSO flow. Also adds `GetIdentityProviderByIdentifier`. Contributed by @prandogabriel (#329)
- **EC2 AuthorizeSecurityGroup returns rules** — `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` and `AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress` now return `SecurityGroupRules` in the response with rule IDs, group ownership, protocol, port range, and CIDR details. Required by Terraform AWS provider v6. Reported by @mspiller (#325)

### Fixed
- **Cognito token claims correctness** — `origin_jti` and `auth_time` claims are now only included in `IdToken` and `AccessToken` (not `RefreshToken`), matching real AWS Cognito behavior. Refresh tokens use minimal claims with only `client_id`.

---

## [1.2.13] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **RDS real MySQL/MariaDB connectivity** — `pymysql` (44 KB, pure Python) is now bundled in the Docker image. When MiniStack runs inside Docker, RDS containers are attached to MiniStack's Docker network with internal IP endpoints for sibling-container connectivity. The public `localhost` endpoint remains unchanged for host-mode access. The Data API authenticates using credentials from Secrets Manager, mapping the master user to MySQL `root` for admin operations. `CreateDBCluster` stores the master password; `CreateDBInstance` inherits credentials from parent clusters; `ModifyDBCluster` propagates password changes to the real MySQL container via `ALTER USER`. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#316)
- **Cognito Identity Provider CRUD** — `CreateIdentityProvider`, `DescribeIdentityProvider`, `UpdateIdentityProvider`, `DeleteIdentityProvider`, `ListIdentityProviders`. Enables SAML/OIDC federation setup in local development. Reported by @prandogabriel (#325)
- **CodeBuild `BatchGetProjects` ARN lookup** — accepts full ARNs in addition to project names, matching real AWS behavior. Contributed by @alexanderkrum-next (#321)

### Fixed
- **SFN States.Format escape handling** — `States.Format` now correctly processes `\'`, `\{`, `\}`, and `\\` escape sequences in template strings, matching AWS behavior. Escaped quotes no longer truncate the template during intrinsic argument parsing. Interpolated values are preserved verbatim (backslashes in arguments are not interpreted as escapes). Contributed by @jayjanssen (#315)
- **S3 GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration returns canonical XML** — lifecycle rules are now parsed on PUT and reconstructed as canonical `<LifecycleConfiguration>` XML on GET, instead of echoing back the raw PUT body. Fixes Terraform Go SDK v2 deserialization failures. Reported by @alexanderkrum-next (#324)
- **Cognito AdminGetUser accepts sub UUID** — `AdminGetUser` and all user-resolving operations now accept the user's `sub` UUID as the `Username` parameter, matching real AWS behavior. Reported by @prandogabriel (#326)
- **Cognito IdToken missing user attributes** — `IdToken` now includes `email`, `cognito:username`, `email_verified`, and other user attributes. Uses `aud` claim instead of `client_id`, matching the OIDC spec and real AWS Cognito. Reported by @prandogabriel (#327)
- **Cognito AnalyticsConfiguration drift** — `AnalyticsConfiguration` defaults to `None` instead of empty dict, preventing Terraform drift on every plan. Contributed by @alexanderkrum-next (#322)

---

## [1.2.12] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **SFN Wait state scaling** — new `SFN_WAIT_SCALE` environment variable (default `1.0`) scales Wait state durations and retry interval sleeps. Set to `0` to skip all waits for fast-forward execution in test scenarios where emulated resources are immediately available. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#310)
- **AutoScaling `DescribeScalingActivities`** — returns empty activities list. Terraform polls this after ASG creation; without it Terraform fails. Contributed by @alexanderkrum-next (#317)
- **Reset with init scripts** — `POST /_ministack/reset?init=1` re-runs boot.d and ready.d init scripts after clearing state. Without this, resources created by init scripts were lost after reset with no way to restore them. Reported by @staranto

### Fixed
- **S3 lifecycle configuration hangs Terraform** — `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration` and `GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration` now return the `x-amz-transition-default-minimum-object-size` header. The Terraform AWS provider waits for this header and hangs indefinitely without it. Reported by @mspiller (#306)
- **Lambda Runtime API noise** — suppressed `BrokenPipeError` tracebacks from Lambda binaries disconnecting after reading the event. This is benign and expected behavior during native `provided` runtime execution. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#311)
- **RDS Data API warning spam** — the `pymysql` import warning is now logged once per process instead of on every `ExecuteStatement` call. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#311)
- **SFN Wait scaling coverage** — `SFN_WAIT_SCALE` now also applies to Activity task timeouts, waitForTaskToken timeouts, and ECS task polling intervals. Runtime config endpoint validates the value (rejects non-numeric, negative, NaN, Inf).

---

## [1.2.11] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **RDS parameter group reset actions** — `ResetDBParameterGroup` and `ResetDBClusterParameterGroup` now clear either selected overrides or the full user-parameter state, matching AWS semantics. Parameter list parsing now accepts both `Parameters.member.N` and `Parameters.Parameter.N` serialization styles. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#298)
- **RDS DbiResourceId lookup** — `DescribeDBInstances` and other instance actions now accept `DbiResourceId` (e.g. `db-1AD581BD3647411AACBF`) in addition to the friendly `DBInstanceIdentifier`. Fixes Terraform/OpenTofu state refresh failures. Contributed by @alexanderkrum-next (#305)

---

## [1.2.10] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- **AppConfig service emulator** — 33 operations across control plane (`appconfig`) and data plane (`appconfigdata`). Applications, environments, configuration profiles, hosted configuration versions, deployment strategies, deployments, tags, and session-based configuration retrieval with token rotation. Contributed by @alexanderkrum-next (#284)
- **Startup `Ready.` log message** — MiniStack now outputs `Ready.` and per-service `<Service> init completed.` messages when the server is ready. Compatible with Testcontainers `LogMessageWaitStrategy` and LocalStack-style readiness detection.

### Fixed
- **SFN aws-sdk error code prefixing** — SDK errors from `aws-sdk:*` task integrations are now prefixed with the service name (e.g. `SecretsManager.ResourceExistsException` instead of bare `ResourceExistsException`), matching real AWS Step Functions behavior. Fixes `Catch` blocks that match on service-specific error codes. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#296)

---

## [1.2.9] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- **AWS CLI bundled in Docker image** — `aws` command now available inside the container for init scripts. Uses AWS CLI v1 via pip (Apache 2.0). Image size increases from 242MB to 269MB. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#272)
- **`.py` init scripts** — ready.d and boot.d directories now support Python scripts in addition to shell scripts. Files ending in `.py` are executed with the container's Python interpreter. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#272)
- **Init script environment defaults** — init scripts automatically receive `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, and `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` so `aws` CLI and boto3 work out of the box without manual configuration.

---

## [1.2.8] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- **SFN intrinsic functions batch 2** — `States.ArrayContains`, `States.ArrayUnique`, `States.ArrayPartition`, `States.ArrayRange`, `States.MathRandom`, `States.MathAdd`, `States.UUID`. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#289)
- **RDS Data API SQL-aware stubs** — when no real database endpoint is available, `ExecuteStatement` now tracks `CREATE/DROP DATABASE`, `CREATE/DROP USER`, and `GRANT/REVOKE` statements in memory per cluster. Verification queries return tracked state. Enables acceptance testing of database provisioning workflows without Docker-in-Docker. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#293)
- **RDS parameter group persistence** — `ModifyDBParameterGroup` and `ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup` now store `ApplyMethod` alongside parameter values. `DescribeDBParameters` and `DescribeDBClusterParameters` return stored parameters with `Source` filter support. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#292)
- **ELBv2 listener attributes** — `DescribeListenerAttributes` and `ModifyListenerAttributes` for ALB listeners. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#286)
- **EC2 subnet tag filtering** — `DescribeSubnets` now supports `tag:*` and `tag-key` filters. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#285)

### Fixed
- **SQS bare queue name as QueueUrl** — passing a bare queue name (e.g. `my-queue`) instead of a full URL now resolves correctly, matching AWS and LocalStack behavior. Previously returned `QueueDoesNotExist`. Reported by @RSzynal-albot
- **Lambda ESM ReportBatchItemFailures** — SQS event source mappings with `FunctionResponseTypes=["ReportBatchItemFailures"]` now parse the handler's `batchItemFailures` response. Failed messages are left on the queue for redelivery/DLQ instead of being silently deleted. Reported by @okinaka
- **SFN REST-JSON PascalCase to camelCase conversion** — `_dispatch_aws_sdk_rest_json` now converts PascalCase parameter names to camelCase before dispatching. Fixes `BadRequestException: resourceArn is required` when Step Functions dispatches to RDS Data API. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#291)
- **SFN query-protocol XML response fidelity** — `_xml_element_to_dict` now coerces known numeric fields to integers, boolean fields to booleans, and detects list-wrapper elements to produce JSON arrays even with a single child. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#290)
- **RDS DescribeDBEngineVersions family prefix** — `DBParameterGroupFamily` no longer double-prefixes the engine name. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#292)

---

## [1.2.7] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **EC2 CreateDefaultVpc** — new action creates a default VPC with all associated resources (3 default subnets, internet gateway, route table, network ACL, security group), matching real AWS behavior. Returns `DefaultVpcAlreadyExists` if one already exists. Reported by @staranto
- **DynamoDB ExecuteStatement (PartiQL)** — supports `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` PartiQL statements with `?` parameter binding. Enables IntelliJ database integration and other PartiQL-based tooling. Reported by @mspiller
- **SNS FIFO topic support** — `.fifo` naming validation, `MessageGroupId`/`MessageDeduplicationId` enforcement, 5-minute deduplication window, sequence numbers, content-based deduplication, FIFO SQS subscription validation, `PublishBatch` FIFO support, thread-safe dedup cache. Contributed by @yskarparis (#279)

### Fixed
- **Lambda UpdateFunctionConfiguration Layers** — attaching layers via `update-function-configuration` no longer throws `'str' object has no attribute 'get'`. Layer ARN strings are now normalized to `{"Arn": ..., "CodeSize": 0}` dicts, matching the `create-function` path. Reported by @Vagator-Prostovich
- **EC2 default VPC network ACL** — the default VPC's network ACL (`acl-00000001`) was referenced but never initialized, causing `DescribeNetworkAcls` to omit it. Now created at startup with standard allow/deny entries.
- **S3 GetObject by VersionId** — requesting a specific version now returns the correct object data. Previously always returned the latest version, ignoring the `versionId` parameter.
- **S3 delete markers in ListObjectVersions** — deleting an object in a versioned bucket now inserts a proper delete marker. `ListObjectVersions` returns `DeleteMarker` elements. Previously delete markers were missing entirely.
- **S3 reset clears version history** — `/_ministack/reset` now clears `_object_versions` store. Previously versioned objects accumulated across resets.
- **Lambda Invoke event payload** — handler event no longer contains an internal `_request_id` field. Previously leaked into the event dict, breaking handlers that validate input shape.
- **Lambda PublishVersion ARN** — `FunctionArn` in the response now includes the version qualifier (e.g. `:1`). Previously returned the unqualified function ARN.
- **DynamoDB BatchWriteItem on nonexistent table** — returns `ResourceNotFoundException` instead of silently placing items into `UnprocessedItems`.
- **WAFv2 DeleteWebACL LockToken** — now enforces `LockToken` validation, returning `WAFOptimisticLockException` for stale tokens. `UpdateWebACL` already enforced this; `DeleteWebACL` was missing the check.
- **Step Functions duplicate execution name** — `StartExecution` with a name already in use returns `ExecutionAlreadyExists`. Previously silently created a second execution.
- **Step Functions Fail state error/cause** — `DescribeExecution` now includes `error` and `cause` fields when execution fails via a Fail state. Previously returned `null` for both.
- **API Gateway v2 CreateApi Description** — `Description` field is now stored and returned. Previously silently dropped.
- **API Gateway v1 CreateResource duplicate** — rejects duplicate `pathPart` under the same parent with `ConflictException`. Previously silently created duplicates.
- **CloudWatch DeleteDashboards nonexistent** — returns `DashboardNotFoundError` for nonexistent dashboards. Previously silently succeeded.
- **RDS DescribeDBInstances error code** — returns `DBInstanceNotFoundFault` (with `Fault` suffix) matching real AWS. Previously returned `DBInstanceNotFound`.
- **SQS CreateQueue attribute mismatch** — creating a queue with the same name but different attributes returns `QueueNameExists`. Previously silently returned the existing queue URL.
- **EC2 TagSpecifications on create operations** — `CreateVpc`, `CreateSubnet`, `CreateSecurityGroup`, `CreateKeyPair`, `CreateInternetGateway`, `CreateRouteTable`, `CreateNatGateway`, `CreateNetworkAcl` now process `TagSpecifications` and persist tags. Previously silently ignored.
- **EC2 DeleteVpc dependency check** — returns `DependencyViolation` when subnets, non-default security groups, or internet gateways are still attached. Previously silently deleted the VPC.
- **EC2 delete default security group blocked** — returns `CannotDelete` when attempting to delete a VPC's default security group. Previously silently deleted it.
- **EC2 RunInstances MinCount > MaxCount** — returns `InvalidParameterCombination` when `MinCount` exceeds `MaxCount`. Previously silently launched instances.
- **EC2 Describe tag sets** — `DescribeRouteTables`, `DescribeVolumes`, `DescribeSnapshots`, `DescribeNatGateways` now read tags from the `_tags` store. Previously returned hardcoded empty `<tagSet/>`.
- **ECS DescribeTaskDefinition tags** — always returns tags in the response. Previously only returned tags when `include=["TAGS"]` was explicitly passed.

---

## [1.2.6] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **EFS timestamp format** — `CreationTime` now returns integer epoch seconds instead of ISO string, fixing Java SDK v2 unmarshalling errors.
- **ECS timestamps** — `createdAt` and other timestamp fields now return integer epoch seconds instead of floats with sub-second precision.
- **DynamoDB `X-Amz-Crc32` header** — all DynamoDB responses now include the CRC32 checksum header, fixing Go SDK v2 `failed to close HTTP response body` warnings.
- **EC2 DescribeInternetGateways not-found** — returns `InvalidInternetGatewayID.NotFound` for nonexistent IDs.
- **EC2 CreateVpc CIDR validation** — rejects invalid CIDR blocks with `InvalidParameterValue`.
- **EC2 duplicate security group rule** — `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` returns `InvalidPermission.Duplicate` for existing rules.
- **EC2 CreateVolume/CreateSnapshot TagSpecifications** — tags specified in `TagSpecifications` are now persisted.
- **ElastiCache CreateCacheSubnetGroup** — `DescribeCacheSubnetGroups` now returns the `Subnets` list with subnet identifiers and availability zones.
- **SNS error code** — `GetTopicAttributes`, `Publish`, and other operations on nonexistent topics now return `NotFound` instead of `NotFoundException`, matching real AWS.
- **LocalStack init script path compatibility** — now supports `/etc/localstack/init/ready.d/` in addition to `/docker-entrypoint-initaws.d/ready.d/` for drop-in LocalStack replacement. Contributed by @AdigaAkhil (#271)
- **CloudWatch error response protocol mismatch** — error responses now match the request protocol (JSON errors for JSON requests, CBOR errors for CBOR requests). Previously, JSON-protocol requests received CBOR-encoded errors causing boto3 `UnicodeDecodeError`.
- **AppSync apiId length** — `CreateGraphQLApi` now generates 26-character alphanumeric IDs matching real AWS format. Previously 8 characters, which broke boto3 ARN validation for tag operations.
- **EC2 CreateTags persistence** — tags applied via `CreateTags` now appear in `DescribeVpcs`, `DescribeSubnets`, `DescribeSecurityGroups`, and `DescribeInternetGateways`. Previously returned empty `<tagSet/>`.
- **EC2 RunInstances TagSpecifications** — tags specified in `TagSpecifications` with `ResourceType=instance` are now persisted and returned in `DescribeInstances`.
- **EC2 Describe not-found errors** — `DescribeVpcs`, `DescribeSubnets`, `DescribeSecurityGroups`, `DescribeKeyPairs`, `DescribeInstances`, `DescribeVolumes`, `DescribeSnapshots` now return proper AWS error codes (`InvalidVpcID.NotFound`, etc.) when specific IDs are requested but don't exist.
- **EFS not-found errors** — `DescribeFileSystems` and `DescribeMountTargets` now return `FileSystemNotFound` / `MountTargetNotFound` for nonexistent IDs.
- **ELBv2 not-found errors** — `DescribeLoadBalancers`, `DescribeTargetGroups` return proper errors for nonexistent ARNs/names. `DeleteListener`, `DeleteTargetGroup` return errors for nonexistent ARNs.
- **ElastiCache not-found errors** — `DescribeCacheSubnetGroups`, `DeleteCacheSubnetGroup`, `DescribeCacheParameterGroups`, `DeleteCacheParameterGroup` now return proper `CacheSubnetGroupNotFoundFault` / `CacheParameterGroupNotFound` errors.
- **Glue validation** — `CreateTable` rejects nonexistent database, `CreateCrawler` rejects duplicate names, `DeleteTable` / `DeleteConnection` return `EntityNotFoundException` for nonexistent resources.
- **CloudFront CallerReference idempotency** — `CreateDistribution` with a duplicate `CallerReference` returns the existing distribution instead of creating a duplicate.
- **WAFv2 LockToken enforcement** — `UpdateWebACL` validates `LockToken` and returns `WAFOptimisticLockException` for stale tokens.
- **WAFv2 duplicate name** — `CreateWebACL` rejects duplicate names within the same scope with `WAFDuplicateItemException`.
- **ServiceDiscovery duplicate namespace** — `CreateHttpNamespace` rejects duplicate names with `NamespaceAlreadyExists`.
- **AutoScaling DescribePolicies** — response now includes `AdjustmentType`, `ScalingAdjustment`, and `Cooldown` fields.
- **ECS TagResource validation** — rejects nonexistent resource ARNs with `InvalidParameterException`.
- **EC2 DescribeVpcs filters** — filters parameter (`owner-id`, `vpc-id`, `cidr`, `state`, `is-default`, `tag:*`) now applied correctly. Previously silently ignored.

---

## [1.2.5] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Secrets Manager partial ARN lookup** — `GetSecretValue` and all other operations now resolve secrets by partial ARN (without the random 6-character suffix), matching real AWS behaviour. Previously returned `ResourceNotFoundException`.
- **Java SDK v2 timestamp compatibility** — all JSON-protocol services now return integer epoch seconds instead of high-precision floats. Fixes `Unable to parse date` and `Input timestamp string must be no longer than 20 characters` errors across DynamoDB, Lambda, Kinesis, CodeBuild, CloudWatch, Glue, Athena, ECR, Secrets Manager, EventBridge, KMS, SNS, Service Discovery, and CloudFormation provisioners. Python and Node.js SDKs are unaffected.
- **DELETE/GET/HEAD requests without body could hang** — ASGI body read loop now skips waiting for a body on methods that don't typically carry one, preventing timeouts under concurrent load.

---

## [1.2.4] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **CodeBuild service** — new service with 11 API operations: CreateProject, BatchGetProjects, ListProjects, UpdateProject, DeleteProject, StartBuild, BatchGetBuilds, StopBuild, ListBuilds, ListBuildsForProject, BatchDeleteBuilds. Contributed by @Nikhiladiga (#253)
- **CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)** — CreateOriginAccessControl, GetOriginAccessControl, GetOriginAccessControlConfig, ListOriginAccessControls, UpdateOriginAccessControl, DeleteOriginAccessControl. Contributed by @yskarparis (#258)
- **CloudFormation `AWS::Route53::RecordSet`** — provisions A, AAAA, CNAME, and alias records with weighted/failover/geo routing support. Contributed by @aldokimi (#263)
- **CloudFormation `AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm`** — provisions metric alarms with full lifecycle (create/delete). Contributed by @aldokimi (#265)
- **Lambda ESM layer symlink** — Node.js ESM `import()` now resolves packages from Lambda Layers via symlinked `node_modules`. Contributed by @bognari (#259)

### Fixed
- **CodeBuild multitenancy** — switched from plain `dict` to `AccountScopedDict` for proper account scoping
- **CFN test merge conflict** — separated mangled CloudWatch Alarm and Route53 RecordSet tests into independent functions

---

## [1.2.3] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Go SDK v2 `failed to close HTTP response body` warning** — uvicorn's default keep-alive timeout (5s) was too short for Go/Java SDK connection pools (~90s idle). Increased to 75s to match AWS ALB defaults. Affected all services, most visible with DynamoDB health checks. Reported by @mspiller (#249)
- **SSM inline tags regression test** — added test for `PutParameter` with inline `Tags` followed by `ListTagsForResource`. Contributed by @bognari (#254)

---

## [1.2.2] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **SSM `ListTagsForResource` crash** — `PutParameter` stored tags as a list but `ListTagsForResource` expected a dict, causing `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'items'`. Blocked all Terraform/OpenTofu deployments creating SSM parameters. Reported by @bognari (#248)

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Dynamic RDS storage** — new `RDS_PERSIST=1` env var switches database containers from fixed-size tmpfs to Docker named volumes for auto-growing persistent storage. Default (`RDS_PERSIST=0`) remains ephemeral tmpfs for CI/CD. Reported by @macario1983 (#248).
- **Dual Docker Hub publishing** — Docker images now publish to both `nahuelnucera/ministack` and `ministackorg/ministack` on tag push.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **AutoScaling service** — new full service with 22 API operations: CreateAutoScalingGroup, DescribeAutoScalingGroups, UpdateAutoScalingGroup, DeleteAutoScalingGroup, CreateLaunchConfiguration, DescribeLaunchConfigurations, DeleteLaunchConfiguration, PutScalingPolicy, DescribePolicies, DeletePolicy, PutLifecycleHook, DescribeLifecycleHooks, DeleteLifecycleHook, CompleteLifecycleAction, RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat, PutScheduledUpdateGroupAction, DescribeScheduledActions, DeleteScheduledAction, CreateOrUpdateTags, DescribeTags, DeleteTags, DescribeAutoScalingInstances.
- **9 new CloudFormation provisioners** — `AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion`, `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`, `AWS::Route53::HostedZone`, `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api`, `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Stage`, `AWS::SES::EmailIdentity`, `AWS::WAFv2::WebACL`, `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution`, `AWS::RDS::DBCluster`. All 9 support create, delete, and Fn::GetAtt. Total provisioners: 66 (was 57).
- **5 AutoScaling CFN provisioners upgraded** — `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup`, `LaunchConfiguration`, `ScalingPolicy`, `LifecycleHook`, `ScheduledAction` now store real data (were stubs).
- **EC2 `DescribeInstanceStatus`** — new operation with `IncludeAllInstances` support. Returns instance state, system status, and instance status.
- **EC2 `DescribeVpcClassicLink` / `DescribeVpcClassicLinkDnsSupport`** — stubs returning empty sets. Unblocks all VPC-dependent Terraform resources (subnet, security group, instance, ALB, NLB, EFS).
- **Test parallelization** — CI now runs tests in parallel with pytest-xdist. Adjusted worker count for CFN stack reliability, added retries for flaky tests, increased CFN stack wait timeout. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#199).
- **SFN REST-JSON `aws-sdk` dispatcher + RDS Data API integration** — Step Functions `aws-sdk:rdsdata:executeStatement` and other RDS Data actions now dispatch via a new REST-JSON protocol handler. Static action→path map avoids botocore dependency. RDS Data API returns stub success when no database endpoint is available, allowing SFN workflows to proceed in mock environments. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#237).
- **Lambda warm worker layer extraction** — warm worker pool now extracts Lambda layers and makes their code available to handlers. Python layers are added to `sys.path` via `_LAMBDA_LAYERS_DIRS` env var. Node.js layers are resolved via `NODE_PATH` pointing to each layer's `nodejs/node_modules` directory. Includes zip-slip protection on extraction. Contributed by @bognari (#236).
- **Lambda Node.js ESM (.mjs) handler support** — Node.js handlers using ES modules (`.mjs` files or `package.json` with `"type": "module"`) now load correctly via dynamic `import()` fallback when `require()` fails with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`. Supports `export const handler`, `export default`, and cross-module ESM imports. Works in both warm worker pool and cold invocation paths. Contributed by @bognari (#238).

### Fixed
- **Terraform AWS provider v5.x compatibility (Lambda, DynamoDB, SFN, ESM)** — Lambda no longer injects default runtime/handler for Image-based functions and preserves `ImageConfigResponse` in create/update responses. ESM omits `StartingPosition` for SQS event sources (only valid for Kinesis/DynamoDB Streams). DynamoDB returns `ProvisionedThroughput` with zero values for PAY_PER_REQUEST tables and GSIs. Step Functions implements `ValidateStateMachineDefinition` stub required by provider v5.42.0+. Contributed by @DaviReisVieira (#242).
- **Kinesis `IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod` rejects same value** — setting retention to 24h (the default) failed with "must be greater than current value". Now accepts same-value as no-op. Blocked `aws_kinesis_stream` in Terraform and Pulumi.
- **ACM `DescribeCertificate` timestamps as ISO strings** — Terraform Go SDK expects epoch floats. `CreatedAt`, `IssuedAt`, `NotBefore`, `NotAfter` now return epoch numbers. Blocked `aws_acm_certificate` in Terraform.
- **Lambda ESM `Enabled` field ignored** — creating an ESM with `Enabled: false` always returned `State: Enabled`. Now respects the request parameter.
- **Lambda ESM `Enabled` field in response** — real AWS does not include `Enabled` in ESM responses, only `State`. Extra field caused Terraform drift.
- **ECS TaskDefinition extra container fields** — `container_definitions` included `environment=[], mountPoints=[], volumesFrom=[], memoryReservation=0` when not specified. Caused Terraform replacement on every apply.
- **DynamoDB `CreateTable` ignores `Tags`** — tags passed in `CreateTable` were not stored. `ListTagsOfResource` returned empty. Terraform re-applied tags every plan.
- **SNS `CreateTopic` ignores `Tags`** — same as DynamoDB. Tags now stored on create.
- **SNS `DisplayName` defaults to topic name** — real AWS defaults to empty string. Caused Terraform drift.
- **SSM `PutParameter` ignores `Tags`** — tags now stored on create.
- **Lambda empty `Environment` block returned** — when no env vars set, response included `Environment: {Variables: {}}`. Terraform tried to remove it every plan. Now omitted when not set.
- **Lambda `DeadLetterConfig` empty object returned** — when not configured, response included `DeadLetterConfig: {}`. Now omitted when not set.
- **Lambda Function URL missing `InvokeMode`** — response lacked `InvokeMode` field. Terraform wanted to set "BUFFERED" every plan. Now defaults to "BUFFERED".
- **Lambda Function URL empty `Cors` block** — `cors: {}` returned when not configured. Now omitted.
- **API Gateway v2 empty `corsConfiguration`** — returned `{}` when not set. Caused Terraform/Pulumi drift.
- **API Gateway v2 missing `apiKeySelectionExpression`** — now defaults to `$request.header.x-api-key`.
- **Cognito UserPool extra empty blocks** — `DeviceConfiguration`, `UserPoolAddOns`, `UsernameConfiguration`, `VerificationMessageTemplate` returned when not set. Now only included when explicitly provided. Added missing `DeletionProtection` field.
- **SNS `GetTopicAttributes` 404 with empty account ARN** — SDKs that skip `GetCallerIdentity` (Pulumi with `skipRequestingAccountId`) construct ARNs with empty account ID (`arn:aws:sns:us-east-1::name`). All SNS operations now normalize these to the default account.
- **SES `DeleteIdentity` malformed XML response** — response lacked `<DeleteIdentityResult/>` element. Go SDK deserialization failed. Also fixed `SetIdentityNotificationTopic` and `SetIdentityFeedbackForwardingEnabled`.
- **Go SDK v2 "failed to close HTTP response body" warning** — all responses lacked `Content-Length` header, causing Uvicorn to use `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. The Go AWS SDK v2 warns on every chunked response close. Now sets `Content-Length` on all responses. Affects all services. Reported by @mspiller.
- **S3 `ListObjectVersions` returns only one version** — when versioning is enabled, multiple PUTs to the same key only stored the latest object. `ListObjectVersions` returned a single version with hardcoded `VersionId: "1"`. Now maintains full version history with unique VersionIds per PUT. Reported by @aldex32.

---

## [1.1.62] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **SFN query-protocol acronym mapper** — Step Functions `aws-sdk:*` integrations now correctly convert SDK-style parameter names (e.g. `DbSubnetGroupName`) to wire-format names (`DBSubnetGroupName`) for query-protocol services (RDS, EC2, IAM, STS, etc.). Uses a static acronym mapping — no botocore dependency. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#235).

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v1/v2 returns mock response for Node.js Lambdas** — `_invoke_lambda_proxy` in both `apigateway.py` (v2) and `apigateway_v1.py` (v1) only dispatched to the warm worker pool for Python runtimes. Node.js Lambdas received a hardcoded `"Mock response"` instead of being executed. Now checks for both `python` and `nodejs` runtimes. Contributed by @bognari (#234).
- **API Gateway v2 missing `pathParameters` in Lambda event** — Routes with path parameters (e.g. `GET /items/{itemId}`) did not extract parameter values into the Lambda proxy event's `pathParameters` field. Now extracts parameters from both `{param}` and `{proxy+}` route templates. Contributed by @bognari (#239).
- **API Gateway v2 `queryStringParameters` incorrect for multi-value params** — Multi-value query parameters (e.g. `?tag=a&tag=b`) were passed as Python lists instead of comma-joined strings. Now joins values with commas (`"tag": "a,b"`) matching the AWS API Gateway v2 payload format 2.0 spec. Contributed by @bognari (#239).
- **API Gateway v2 `rawQueryString` stringified lists** — Multi-value query parameters were rendered as `tag=['a', 'b']` instead of `tag=a&tag=b`. Now expands repeated keys correctly. Contributed by @bognari (#239).
- **Lambda Docker executor fails for `provided` runtimes** — `_execute_function_docker()` mounted Lambda code only at `/var/task` and overrode CMD to `["/var/task/bootstrap"]`, but the AWS RIE entrypoint expects the bootstrap binary at `/var/runtime/bootstrap`. Now mounts code at both `/var/task` and `/var/runtime` and passes `"bootstrap"` as CMD. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#232).
- **Lambda `print()` / `console.log()` output lost in warm worker pool** — Python handler `print()` wrote to stdout, colliding with the JSON-line protocol between worker and host. Now redirects Python stdout to stderr (matching the existing Node.js worker behavior). Worker `invoke()` drains stderr after each invocation and returns it as `log`. ESM success paths (SQS, Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams) now emit handler output to the MiniStack log. Direct `Invoke` with `LogType=Tail` returns the output in `X-Amz-Log-Result`. Reported by @PerhapsJack.

---
## [1.1.61] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **EC2 `DescribeTags` ignores filters** — `DescribeTags` returned every tag for every resource regardless of `Filter` parameters. Terraform's `aws_instance` resource sends `resource-id` and `key` filters when reading launch template tags; receiving unrelated tags caused "too many results: wanted 1, got 3". Now respects `resource-id`, `resource-type`, `key`, and `value` filters. Reported by @m7w.
- **EC2 `DescribeTags` returns wrong `resourceType`** — resources with prefixes `acl-`, `nat-`, `dopt-`, `eigw-`, `lt-`, `pl-`, `vgw-`, `cgw-`, `ami-`, `tgw-` were returned as generic `"resource"` instead of their correct types (`network-acl`, `natgateway`, `launch-template`, etc.). Reported by @m7w.
- **Lambda container networking in DinD** — when MiniStack runs inside a Docker container (DinD via socket mount), `127.0.0.1` refers to the MiniStack container itself, not the Docker host where the Lambda container's port is mapped. When `LAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK` is set, Lambda invocations now resolve the container's IP on the shared network and connect directly on port 8080. Contributed by @DaviReisVieira. Fixes #228.

---

## [1.1.60] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Native `provided` / `provided.al2023` Lambda runtime** — Lambda functions using custom runtimes (Go, Rust, C++ compiled binaries) now execute natively without Docker. MiniStack implements the Lambda Runtime API (`GET /invocation/next`, `POST /invocation/{id}/response`) as a minimal HTTP server, extracts the bootstrap binary from the deployment package, and manages the invocation lifecycle. Handles Go's default chunked `Transfer-Encoding`. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#220).
- **States.ArrayGetItem, States.Array, States.ArrayLength intrinsics** — SFN state machines using `States.ArrayGetItem(array, index)`, `States.Array(val1, val2, ...)`, and `States.ArrayLength(array)` now execute correctly. Cherry-picked from @jayjanssen (#218).
- **SFN key naming convention** — API response keys like `DBClusters` are now converted to Java SDK V2 convention (`DbClusters`) matching real AWS SFN behavior. Applied to both query-protocol and JSON-protocol aws-sdk dispatchers. Cherry-picked from @jayjanssen (#218).
- **RDS `EnableHttpEndpoint` action** — stub that accepts and stores the flag on DB clusters. Cherry-picked from @jayjanssen (#218).

### Fixed
- **Lambda provided-runtime race conditions** — fixed port allocation race (socket bind-then-close replaced with `TCPServer` port 0 atomic bind) and server-ready race (bootstrap process now waits for Runtime API server to be accepting connections before starting).
- **`States.TaskFailed` treated as catch-all** — `Retry` and `Catch` blocks matching `States.TaskFailed` now catch any Task error, matching AWS behavior. Cherry-picked from @jayjanssen (#218).
- **Map state `ItemSelector` path resolution** — `$` paths in `ItemSelector` now resolve against the Map state's effective input instead of the individual item. The item is available via `$$.Map.Item.Value`. Cherry-picked from @jayjanssen (#218).
- **CFN inline ZipFile uses correct extension for Node.js** — `_zip_inline` now writes `index.js` for Node.js runtimes instead of always writing `index.py`. Fixes CDK `Code.fromInline` with Node.js failing at invocation. Reported by @jolo-dev.
- **EC2 `DescribeSubnets` filter support** — `DescribeSubnets` now respects `vpc-id`, `availability-zone`, `subnet-id`, and `default-for-az` filters. Previously all filters were silently ignored.

---

## [1.1.59] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- **EventBridge expanded API coverage** — 20 new actions: `ListRuleNamesByTarget`, `TestEventPattern`, `UpdateArchive`, `StartReplay`, `DescribeReplay`, `ListReplays`, `CancelReplay`, `CreateEndpoint`, `DeleteEndpoint`, `DescribeEndpoint`, `ListEndpoints`, `UpdateEndpoint`, `DeauthorizeConnection`, `ActivateEventSource`, `DeactivateEventSource`, `DescribeEventSource`, `CreatePartnerEventSource`, `DeletePartnerEventSource`, `DescribePartnerEventSource`, `ListPartnerEventSources`, `ListPartnerEventSourceAccounts`, `ListEventSources`, `PutPartnerEvents`. Contributed by @aldokimi (#210).
- **CloudFormation `AWS::Kinesis::Stream` provisioner** — create/delete with `ShardCount`, `Name`, `RetentionPeriodHours`, `StreamModeDetails` (ON_DEMAND/PROVISIONED); `Fn::GetAtt` for `Arn`, `StreamId`. Also registered `rds-data` in service handler routing. Contributed by @aldokimi (#207).
- **EC2 default subnets** — default VPC now creates 3 subnets (one per AZ: a/b/c) matching real AWS behavior instead of a single subnet. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#205).
- **Step Functions `States.JsonToString` intrinsic** — counterpart to `States.StringToJson`. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#215).
- **CloudFormation `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer` and `::Listener` provisioners** — create/delete with full ALB lifecycle, including default rules, tag propagation, and cascading cleanup. `Fn::GetAtt` for `Arn`, `DNSName`, `LoadBalancerFullName`, `CanonicalHostedZoneID`. Contributed by @aldokimi (#217).

### Fixed
- **EventBridge ARN-as-bus-name in PutEvents** — events published with a full ARN as `EventBusName` (e.g. `arn:aws:events:us-east-1:000000000000:event-bus/my-bus`) were silently dropped because the bus name comparison against rules failed. `PutEvents` now normalizes ARN-style values to the plain bus name before dispatch. Contributed by @ctnnguyen (#208).
- **CloudFormation EventBridge rule composite key** — `_eb_rule_create` and `_eb_rule_delete` used reversed key order (`name|bus` instead of `bus|name`), making CFN-provisioned rules invisible to the EventBridge API (`DescribeRule`, `ListTargetsByRule`) and event dispatch. Now uses `_eb._rule_key()` for consistent key construction. Contributed by @ctnnguyen (#208).
- **CloudFormation EventBridge target storage** — CFN rule provisioner cherry-picked only `Id`, `Arn`, `RoleArn`, `Input`, `InputPath` from targets, dropping `InputTransformer`, `SqsParameters`, `EcsParameters`, and other properties. Now stores the full target dict. Contributed by @ctnnguyen (#208).
- **Step Functions aws-sdk action casing** — SFN ARNs use camelCase (e.g. `createDBSubnetGroup`) but query-protocol and JSON-protocol services expect PascalCase (`CreateDBSubnetGroup`). Both dispatch paths now capitalize the first letter. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#204, #215).
- **RDS `_parse_member_list` botocore format** — list parameters dispatched via Step Functions aws-sdk integrations use `Prefix.MemberName.N` format instead of `Prefix.member.N`. The parser now handles both formats.

## Added
-- **Lambda `invoke` action** - Modified the running of the lambda to always use AWS provided Runtime Interface Emulator images. This way any container image that implements the RIE can be run. Removed the support for running dockers using a wrapper script. Container will be reused if possible. Containers are kept running
and reference by the sha256 over the code image. In the future this should be a combination of the code image and the config.
---

## [1.1.58] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Kinesis CBOR protocol support** — `PutRecord` and `PutRecords` from the AWS Java SDK v2 failed with `'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xbf`. The Java SDK sends Kinesis requests as CBOR (`application/x-amz-cbor-1.1`) by default, but the handler only accepted JSON. Kinesis now detects CBOR content-type, decodes with `cbor2`, and returns CBOR-encoded responses. Reported by @markwimpory.

---

## [1.1.57] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **EventBridge wildcard and content-filter patterns not matching** — event patterns using `{"wildcard": "*simple*"}`, `{"prefix": "..."}`, `{"suffix": "..."}`, etc. in top-level fields like `detail-type` and `source` were silently ignored. Content-based filters now work in all pattern fields, not just `detail`. Also added `wildcard` support to the content filter engine (uses `fnmatch` glob matching). Reported by @jfisbein
- **IAM tags not saved on CreateRole/CreateUser** — tags passed at creation time via `Tags.member.N.Key/Value` were silently ignored. `GetRole` and `GetUser` now return tags set during creation. Same pattern as the KMS and SQS tag fixes in prior releases.
- **Multi-tenant state persistence loses non-default accounts on restart** — when `PERSIST_STATE=1`, resources created under custom account IDs were restored under `000000000000` after container restart. Affected services: **S3**, **Lambda**, **ECS**, **KMS**. All four services' `get_state()` functions now iterate all accounts' data (via `_data`) instead of only the current request context. S3 file persistence (`S3_DATA_DIR`) layout changed to `DATA_DIR/<account_id>/<bucket>/<key>`; legacy flat layout auto-detected on load. The other 14 services (SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, IAM, EC2, SSM, etc.) were already safe — they use `copy.deepcopy()` which preserves all accounts.

---

## [1.1.56] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Multi-tenancy state isolation** — resources with the same name in different accounts no longer collide. All service state dicts use `AccountScopedDict` which namespaces by account ID automatically. Previously, multi-tenancy (v1.1.54) only changed ARN generation — the underlying state was shared. Now IAM roles, S3 buckets, SQS queues, DynamoDB tables, and all other resources are fully isolated per account. Reported by community feedback.
- **Graceful Docker container cleanup on shutdown** — RDS, ECS, and ElastiCache Docker containers are now stopped and removed when MiniStack shuts down, using Docker labels (`ministack=rds`, `ministack=ecs`, `ministack=elasticache`). Previously containers were orphaned unless `/_ministack/reset` was called explicitly.

### Fixed
- **SQS queue tags not saved on CreateQueue** — tags passed at queue creation time were silently ignored. `ListQueueTags` now returns tags set during `CreateQueue` for both JSON and Query API protocols. Reported by @jfisbein
- **PERSIST_STATE compatibility with AccountScopedDict** — state serialization and deserialization now handle the new scoped dict format correctly. All 37 service state files save and restore across restarts.

---

## [1.1.55] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **IAM/CloudFormation JSON protocol support** — IAM and CloudFormation now handle `AwsJson1_1` protocol requests (used by newer AWS SDK versions and CDK CLI). v1.1.54 added JSON protocol support for STS only, but some CDK/SDK versions also send IAM and CloudFormation requests via JSON protocol, causing "The security token included in the request is invalid" errors.
- **CloudFormation AutoScaling stubs** — `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup`, `LaunchConfiguration`, `ScalingPolicy`, `LifecycleHook`, and `ScheduledAction` are now handled as no-ops, allowing CDK/CFN stacks with ASGs to deploy without failing. Reported by @titan1978
- **README KMS table formatting** — KMS row was detached from the services table by a blank line, causing broken rendering.

---

## [1.1.54] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Multi-tenancy via dynamic Account ID** — When `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` is a 12-digit number (e.g. `048408301323`), MiniStack uses it as the Account ID for all ARN generation. Non-numeric keys fall back to `MINISTACK_ACCOUNT_ID` env var or `000000000000`. Enables lightweight tenant isolation on shared endpoints without configuration changes.
- **CloudFormation `TemplateURL` support** — `CreateStack`, `UpdateStack`, `CreateChangeSet`, and `GetTemplateSummary` now fetch templates from S3 when `TemplateURL` is provided instead of `TemplateBody`. This unblocks `cdk deploy` which publishes templates to S3 and passes a URL.
- **CloudFormation `AWS::CDK::Metadata` support** — CDK metadata resources are now handled as no-ops instead of failing with "Unsupported resource type".
- **STS JSON protocol support** — STS now handles `AwsJson1_1` protocol requests (used by newer AWS SDK versions and CDK CLI). Previously, STS only accepted Query/form-encoded requests, causing CDK to fail with "The security token included in the request is invalid" when it tried to AssumeRole using the JSON protocol.
- **CloudFormation AutoScaling stubs** — `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup`, `LaunchConfiguration`, `ScalingPolicy`, `LifecycleHook`, and `ScheduledAction` are now handled as no-ops, allowing CDK/CFN stacks with ASGs to deploy without failing. Reported by @titan1978

### Fixed
- **Test coverage for v1.1.53 fixes** — added unit tests for `_convert_parameters` (RDS Data API parameter binding) and SSM epoch timestamp in CloudFormation provisioner.

---

## [1.1.53] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **RDS Aurora Global Clusters (5 operations)** — `CreateGlobalCluster`, `DescribeGlobalClusters`, `DeleteGlobalCluster`, `RemoveFromGlobalCluster`, `ModifyGlobalCluster`. In-memory global cluster model with member cluster membership, source cluster auto-attach, deletion protection, and rename support. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#194)
- **RDS Data API service** — `ExecuteStatement`, `BatchExecuteStatement`, `BeginTransaction`, `CommitTransaction`, `RollbackTransaction`. Routes SQL to the real database containers MiniStack spins up for RDS instances. Supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL engines. Contributed by @jayjanssen (#193)

### Fixed
- **CDK deploy "implicit NaN" deserialization error** — the CloudFormation SSM provisioner stored `LastModifiedDate` as an ISO 8601 string instead of a Unix epoch float. The JS SDK v3 (bundled in CDK CLI) uses `AwsJson1_1Protocol` for SSM and calls `parseEpochTimestamp()` on the value, which expects a number. `cdk deploy` would fail immediately after bootstrap when checking the SSM bootstrap version parameter. Reported by @youngkwangk @jolo-dev and @ben-shearlaw
- **RDS Data API thread safety** — added `threading.Lock` to protect transaction state against concurrent access
- **RDS Data API parameter binding** — `ExecuteStatement` and `BatchExecuteStatement` now convert RDS Data API `:name` parameters to DB-API parameterized queries instead of ignoring them
- **RDS Data API connection leak** — connections are now properly closed on exceptions in non-transaction execute paths
- **RDS Data API deps** — added `psycopg2-binary` and `pymysql` to `[full]` and `[dev]` optional dependencies in `pyproject.toml`

---

## [1.1.52] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **SQS queue URL hostname resolution** — `QueueUrl` with a different hostname (e.g. `http://ministack:4566/...` in docker-compose) now resolves correctly. The queue lookup extracts the queue name from the URL and falls back to name-based resolution when the exact URL doesn't match.
- **SQS FIFO dedup cache not cleared on message delete** — Deleting a FIFO message now clears its deduplication cache entry, so the same `MessageDeduplicationId` can be reused immediately. Previously, the 5-minute dedup window blocked re-sends even after the message was consumed and deleted, breaking test reruns with fixed dedup IDs. Reported by @mspiller
- **API Gateway deadlock when Lambda calls back to MiniStack** — Lambda invocations from API Gateway (both v1 REST and v2 HTTP) now run in a thread pool (`asyncio.to_thread`), preventing deadlock when the Lambda handler makes HTTP requests back to MiniStack. Contributed by @rankinjl (#191)

### Changed
- **Tests split into per-service files** — The monolithic `test_services.py` (21K lines) has been split into ~45 focused test files (`test_s3.py`, `test_sqs.py`, `test_ec2.py`, etc.). Contributed by @jgrumboe (#189)
- **Lambda runtime env vars set before handler load** — `LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`, and `_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN` are now available at import time (cold start), matching real AWS Lambda behavior. Contributed by @lubond (#190)

---

## [1.1.51] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **EC2 Launch Templates (6 operations)** — `CreateLaunchTemplate`, `CreateLaunchTemplateVersion`, `DescribeLaunchTemplates`, `DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions`, `ModifyLaunchTemplate`, `DeleteLaunchTemplate`. Full versioning support with `$Latest` / `$Default` resolution, block device mappings, network interfaces, IAM instance profiles, and tag specifications.
- **CFN `AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate`** — Launch templates now work in CloudFormation/CDK stacks. 53 CFN resource types total.

### Fixed
- **KMS tags and policy not saved on key creation** — `CreateKey` was ignoring `Tags` and `Policy` parameters, so they were lost until explicitly set via `TagResource` / `PutKeyPolicy`. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#183)
- **SQS FIFO `ReceiveMessage` returns all messages in same group** — was incorrectly returning only 1 message per MessageGroupId per batch. AWS allows up to 10 messages from the same group in a single `ReceiveMessage` call; the per-group restriction only applies to subsequent calls while messages are in-flight. Reported by @mspiller (#179)

---

## [1.1.50] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **CFN `AWS::ECS::Cluster`, `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition`, `AWS::ECS::Service`** — ECS resources now work in CloudFormation/CDK stacks. 51 CFN resource types total.

---

## [1.1.49] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **EventBridge `UpdateEventBus`** — new operation for Terraform `aws_cloudwatch_event_bus`. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#177)
- **EventBridge `Description` and `Policy` fields** — `DescribeEventBus` and `ListEventBuses` now return description, policy, and `LastModifiedTime`

### Fixed
- **Lambda `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker` ignored for Python/Node runtimes** — warm pool always took priority over the Docker executor setting. Now `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker` routes all runtimes through Docker for clean log output. Contributed by @PorterK (#178)
- **Lambda Docker fallback crash** — `runtime` referenced before definition when Docker SDK unavailable
- **EventBridge timestamps** — all timestamp fields now return epoch numbers instead of ISO strings. Fixes Terraform deserialization. Legacy ISO strings in persisted state auto-coerced on restore. Contributed by @jgrumboe (#177)

- **Step Functions sync execution error details** — `StartSyncExecution` now returns `error` and `cause` fields for failed executions, matching AWS SFN behaviour. Contributed by @jayjanssen

### Fixed
- **S3 `PutObject` missing `Content-Length: 0` header** — CDK deploy failed with `Expected real number, got implicit NaN` because the JS SDK v3 parsed the missing header as NaN. Reported by @youngkwangk (#160)
- **README reverts from stale PR branches** — restored Cloud Map, ready.d, persistence list, SFN intrinsics documentation


### Tests

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v2 `lastUpdatedDate` returned as ISO8601 string** — Stage and Deployment `lastUpdatedDate` was returning Unix timestamp (number), causing Terraform deserialization failure on `aws_apigatewayv2_stage`. Reported by @hmarcuzzo (#132)
- **ECS timestamp wire format** — all ECS timestamp fields (`createdAt`, `startedAt`, `stoppedAt`, etc.) now return epoch numbers instead of ISO strings. Fixes SDK deserialization for Go, Java, and other typed SDKs

### Tests
- 4 new tests: EMR instance fleets, ECS timestamp format, API GW v2 stage timestamps, CDK bootstrap full stack

---

## [1.1.43] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **CFN `AWS::ECR::Repository`** — CDK bootstrap (`cdk bootstrap`) now works. Reported by @youngkwangk (#152)

---

## [1.1.41] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **ElastiCache persistence crash on restart** — `restore_state()` called `_get_docker()` before it was defined, causing `NameError` when `PERSIST_STATE=1`. Reported by @adamkirk (#145)
- **RDS persistence crash on restart** — same `_get_docker()` ordering issue in `restore_state()`

---

## [1.1.40] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **State persistence for ALL services** — 11 remaining services now support `PERSIST_STATE=1`: ALB, Glue, EFS, WAF, Athena, EMR, CloudFront, ACM, Firehose, SES, SES v2. All 35+ services now persist state across restarts.
- **Step Functions persistence** — state machines, executions, tags, and activities persist. RUNNING executions restored as FAILED with `States.ServiceRestart`. Contributed by @TheJokersThief (#141)

---

## [1.1.39] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **AppSync persistence crash on restart** — `restore_state()` called before it was defined in the file, causing `NameError` when `PERSIST_STATE=1` and restarting. Reported by @samiuoi (#66)
- **Cognito `AdminSetUserPassword` with `Permanent=false`** — now correctly sets `UserStatus` to `FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD`. Previously the password was updated but the status wasn't changed.

- **Docker socket documentation** — README quickstart now shows `-v /var/run/docker.sock` for RDS, ECS, and Lambda container features

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v2 `CreatedDate` returned as ISO8601 string** — was returning Unix timestamp (number), causing Terraform AWS Provider v5/v6 deserialization failure on `aws_apigatewayv2_api`. Reported by @hmarcuzzo (#132)

---

## [1.1.37] — 2026-04-05

### Added

- **EC2 Customer Gateways** — `CreateCustomerGateway`, `DescribeCustomerGateways`, `DeleteCustomerGateway`
- **Lambda `provided` runtime support** — `provided.al2023`, `provided.al2` runtimes now execute via Docker using the AWS Lambda RIE; code is mounted to `/var/task` matching real AWS behavior; Go, Rust, and C++ Lambda functions work correctly with companion files accessible at `LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`
- **KMS Terraform support** — `EnableKeyRotation`, `DisableKeyRotation`, `GetKeyRotationStatus`, `GetKeyPolicy`, `PutKeyPolicy`, `ListKeyPolicies`, `EnableKey`, `DisableKey`, `ScheduleKeyDeletion`, `CancelKeyDeletion`, `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, `ListResourceTags`; KMS now has 27 actions (was 14). Fixes Terraform `aws_kms_key` with `enable_key_rotation = true`. Reported by @betorvs
- **Docker image: `cryptography` package included** — KMS RSA Sign/Verify/GetPublicKey now work out of the box in the Docker image (+20MB image size, 211MB → 231MB)

### Stats
- EC2 now supports **127 actions** (was 109)
- Full Terraform VPC module coverage: 98/98 actions for 20 resource types

### Tests
- 988 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.35] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **EC2 `CreateVpc` creates per-VPC default resources** — each new VPC now gets its own main route table, default network ACL (with standard allow/deny rules), and default security group. Previously all VPCs shared global defaults, so Terraform couldn't find VPC-specific resources
- **EC2 `DescribeNetworkAcls` `default` filter** — Terraform looks up `default_network_acl_id` via `DescribeNetworkAcls` with `vpc-id` + `default=true`, not from the VPC object. Now works
- **EC2 `DescribeSecurityGroups` `vpc-id`/`group-name` filters** — Terraform looks up `default_security_group_id` via these filters. Now works
- **EC2 `DescribeRouteTables` `association.main` filter** — Terraform finds the main route table for a VPC using this filter. Now works
- **EC2 route target types preserved** — `CreateRoute`/`ReplaceRoute` now store `NatGatewayId`, `InstanceId`, `VpcPeeringConnectionId`, `TransitGatewayId` as distinct fields; XML output uses correct element names

### Reported by
- @betorvs — Terraform VPC module v6.6.0 `default_network_acl_id` missing (#107, #108)

---

## [1.1.34] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **EC2 `DescribeRouteTables` filter by association ID** — `association.route-table-association-id`, `association.subnet-id`, `vpc-id` filters now supported. Fixes Terraform 5-minute timeout polling route table associations after `AssociateRouteTable`. Reported by @betorvs (#107, #108)

---

## [1.1.33] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **DynamoDB `ScanFilter` / `QueryFilter`** — legacy filter conditions (EQ, NE, NOT_NULL, NULL, CONTAINS, BEGINS_WITH) now supported alongside FilterExpression
- **CFN `AWS::AppSync::*`** — GraphQLApi, DataSource, Resolver, GraphQLSchema, ApiKey provisioners for CDK/Amplify stacks
- **CFN `AWS::SecretsManager::Secret`** — with `GenerateSecretString` support (PasswordLength, ExcludeCharacters, SecretStringTemplate, GenerateStringKey)
- **S3 `UploadPartCopy`** — copy a range from an existing object as a multipart upload part; supports `x-amz-copy-source-range`
- **SNS FIFO dedup passthrough** — `MessageGroupId` and `MessageDeduplicationId` from SNS Publish now forwarded to SQS FIFO queues via fanout
- **AppSync GraphQL data plane** — `POST /v1/apis/{apiId}/graphql` executes queries and mutations against DynamoDB resolvers; supports create/get/list/update/delete operations, nested input objects, field selection, Lambda resolvers; enables Amplify Data runtime
- **CFN Cognito resource types** — `AWS::Cognito::UserPool`, `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient`, `AWS::Cognito::IdentityPool`, `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolDomain` for Amplify/CDK auth stacks

### Fixed
- **DynamoDB persistence crash** — `defaultdict(dict)` deserialized as plain `dict` after restart, causing `KeyError` on new partition keys. Now converts back to `defaultdict` on restore
- **DynamoDB `_pitr_settings` not persisted** — `DescribeContinuousBackups` now survives restarts
- **Cognito JWT `kid` mismatch** — tokens now use `kid: ministack-key-1` matching the JWKS endpoint; fixes client-side JWT validation
- **KMS RSA private keys persisted** — private keys now PEM-encoded in state; Sign/Verify work after restart (requires `cryptography` package)
- **4 duplicate test function names** — `test_lambda_publish_version`, `test_kinesis_stream_encryption`, `test_apigw_delete_route` renamed to unique names; previously only last definition ran
- **EC2 Terraform VPC module fixes** — `DescribeAddressesAttribute`, `DescribeSecurityGroupRules`, route table association state (`associated`), VPC `defaultNetworkAclId`/`defaultSecurityGroupId`/`mainRouteTableId` in CreateVpc/DescribeVpcs responses. Reported by @betorvs

### Tests
- 955 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.31] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **S3→Lambda notifications silently failing** — `_invoke` is async but was called from sync context; coroutine was never awaited. Now uses direct `_execute_function` in background thread
- **SNS HTTP delivery crash from background threads** — `asyncio.ensure_future` fails with no event loop when `_fanout` called from S3/EventBridge threads. Now uses `threading.Thread(target=asyncio.run, ...)`
- **ACCOUNT_ID configurable across all services** — `MINISTACK_ACCOUNT_ID` env var now respected by all 37 services and router; previously only 6 services read it
- **EventBridge SQS dispatch missing message fields** — now calls `_ensure_msg_fields` after appending, preventing KeyError on ReceiveMessage
- **README: stale test count and service count** — updated to 948 tests, 37 services

- **CloudFormation `AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition`** — no-op stub, returns immediately
- **CloudFormation `AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle`** — no-op stub, returns placeholder URL

### Fixed
- **Router duplicate action keys** — removed `ListTagsForResource` and `GetTemplate` from action map (shared across services, routed via credential scope instead)
- **ElastiCache reset missing state** — `_param_group_params` now cleared and `_port_counter` reset to `BASE_PORT` on reset
- **Bare except in Docker cleanup** — RDS, ECS, ElastiCache reset() now log warnings instead of silently swallowing errors
- **52 f-string logger calls** — converted to lazy % formatting across 13 service files; avoids unnecessary string formatting when log level is disabled
- **Detached mode log handle** — documented intentional fd inheritance in subprocess.Popen

Thanks to @moabukar for #104 (error handling, routing conflicts, persistence hardening)

---

## [1.1.29] — 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation `AWS::S3::BucketPolicy`** — new resource type; provisions and deletes S3 bucket policies via CFN stacks. Fixes Serverless Framework deployment failures

---

## [1.1.28] — 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **S3 aws-chunked decoding** — chunked body decoder now also triggers on `Content-Encoding: aws-chunked` and `x-amz-decoded-content-length` header, not only `STREAMING-*`; fixes AWS SDK Java v2 and Spring Boot S3Template storing raw chunk metadata in object bodies. Strips `aws-chunked` from Content-Encoding before passing to S3 handler. Contributed by @moabukar

---

## [1.1.27] — 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Dockerfile missing `defusedxml`** — added `defusedxml>=0.7` to pip install in Dockerfile; container was crashing on startup due to missing dependency introduced in v1.1.26

---

## [1.1.26] — 2026-04-03

### Added

- **SNS/SFN pagination** — ListTopics, ListSubscriptions, ListStateMachines, ListExecutions now support NextToken/maxResults
- **defusedxml** — S3 and Route53 XML parsing now uses `defusedxml` to protect against billion-laughs DoS

### Fixed
- **SecretsManager `BatchGetSecretValue`** — retrieve multiple secrets in one call; returns `SecretValues` and `Errors` arrays
- **DynamoDB `WarmThroughput`** — DescribeTable now returns `WarmThroughput` field; fixes latest Terraform AWS provider compatibility. Reported by @chad-bekmezian-snap
- **Firehose deadlock** — `_next_dest_id` no longer acquires lock (always called within `_lock` context)
- **Redis bound to localhost** — docker-compose.yml Redis port now `127.0.0.1:6379:6379`
- **EDGE_PORT documented** — added to README Configuration table as LocalStack alias

---

## [1.1.25] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **State persistence for 10 services** — SQS, SNS, SSM, SecretsManager, IAM, DynamoDB, KMS, EventBridge, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis now persist state when `PERSIST_STATE=1`; state is saved on shutdown and restored on startup via atomic JSON files
- **Python Testcontainers example** — `Testcontainers/python-testcontainers/` with pytest tests for S3, SQS, DynamoDB using the `testcontainers` package
- **Detached mode** — `ministack -d` starts the server in the background with logs to `/tmp/ministack-{port}.log`; `ministack --stop` stops it. Cross-platform via `subprocess.Popen`. PID file with signal cleanup. Reported by @UdayKiranPadhy

### Fixed
- **Renamed `examples/` to `Testcontainers/`** — clearer folder name for Testcontainers examples (Java, Go, Python)
- **EventBridge SQS dispatch message schema** — fixed field names (`md5_body`, `sys`, `message_attributes`) to match SQS internal format
- **Lambda `_now_iso()` millisecond precision** — now includes real milliseconds instead of always `.000`
- **`x-amz-id-2` header** — now returns base64-encoded random bytes instead of a UUID, matching AWS format
- **Route53 `ListResourceRecordSets` ordering and pagination** — DNS names now sorted by reversed labels (`com.example.www`) matching AWS; pagination cursors point to next page start instead of current page end; fixes Terraform infinite loop on `aws_route53_record`. Contributed by @jgrumboe
- **Lazy stdlib imports removed** — moved `shutil`, `tempfile`, `argparse`, `signal`, `socket`, `sys`, `datetime` to module level across `app.py`, `lambda_svc.py`, `athena.py`
- **Flaky ESM visibility timeout test** — increased timeout headroom for CI environments

### Tests
- 887 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.24] — 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **KMS aliases** — CreateAlias, DeleteAlias, ListAliases, UpdateAlias; `alias/my-key` resolves in Encrypt, Decrypt, Sign, Verify, DescribeKey and all other KMS operations
- **KMS `REGION` hardcoded** — now reads `MINISTACK_REGION` env var like all other services
- **S3 hardcoded `us-east-1`** — bucket region header, location constraint, and event notifications now use `MINISTACK_REGION`
- **Router `extract_region` fallback** — now uses `MINISTACK_REGION` instead of hardcoded `us-east-1`
- **EC2/RDS XML escaping** — user-controlled values (tags, descriptions) now escaped with `xml.sax.saxutils.escape()`
- **SQS thread safety** — added `_queues_lock` for ESM poller access
- **EC2 terminated instances cleaned up** — removed from memory after 60s
- **Step Functions execution cleanup** — cleaned up when parent state machine is deleted

In-memory key storage with RSA signing via the `cryptography` package (optional dependency, guarded import). Supports JWT signing flows and S3 SSE-KMS encryption patterns. Contributed by @Jolley71717

---

## [1.1.22] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Step Functions mock config** — `SFN_MOCK_CONFIG` (or `LOCALSTACK_SFN_MOCK_CONFIG`) env var pointing to a JSON file that mocks Task state responses; fully compatible with the AWS Step Functions Local mock config format: `MockedResponses` with invocation indexing (`"0"`, `"1-2"`, etc.), `#TestCaseName` ARN suffix on `StartExecution`, `Return` and `Throw` per attempt. Contributed by @maxence-leblanc (issue)
- **Step Functions `TestState` API** — execute a single state in isolation without creating a state machine; supports Pass, Task, Choice, Wait, Succeed, Fail state types; `inspectionLevel` (INFO/DEBUG) returns data transformation details; `mock` parameter for Task states with `result`/`errorOutput`; `stateName` to extract a state from a full definition; Retry/Catch evaluation with `RETRIABLE`/`CAUGHT_ERROR` status

### Fixed
- **CloudWatch Logs `GetLogEvents` pagination** — `nextForwardToken` and `nextBackwardToken` now return the caller's token when at end of stream, preventing SDK clients from looping infinitely; token-based offset pagination now works correctly
- **EventBridge → Lambda crash** — `asyncio.run()` inside the running event loop replaced with direct synchronous dispatch; PutEvents with Lambda targets no longer crashes
- **Step Functions StartSyncExecution crash** — `_call_lambda` replaced `asyncio.run()` with direct `_execute_function()` call; sync Lambda Task states no longer crash
- **`/_ministack/config` endpoint hardened** — now whitelists allowed config keys instead of accepting arbitrary `__import__` + `setattr` on any module
- **S3 path traversal in persistence** — `_persist_object` validates paths stay within `DATA_DIR` using `os.path.realpath()` prefix check; blocks `../` in S3 keys
- **Lambda worker reset** — `reset()` now acquires lock and calls `worker.kill()` (cleans up temp dirs) instead of bare `_proc.terminate()`
- **DynamoDB `_stream_records` cleared on reset** — stream records no longer accumulate unboundedly across resets
- **Lambda ESM position tracking cleared on reset** — `_kinesis_positions` and `_dynamodb_stream_positions` now cleared on `reset()`
- **License** — updated year 2026

### Tests
- 851 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.21] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **S3 → EventBridge notifications** — buckets with `EventBridgeConfiguration` enabled now publish events to the default EventBridge bus on object create/delete/copy; EventBridge rules with `InputTransformer` route and reshape events to downstream targets (SQS, Lambda, etc.)

### Fixed
- **S3 `PutObject` missing `VersionId` in response** — versioned buckets now return `VersionId` in the `PutObject`, `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, and `CopyObject` responses; each put generates a unique version ID. Reported by @McDoit

### Tests
- 841 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.20] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **SecretsManager `KmsKeyId`** — `CreateSecret` and `UpdateSecret` now store `KmsKeyId`; `DescribeSecret` returns it. Previously always null.
- **Lambda env vars applied at process spawn** — Lambda environment variables are now passed to the worker subprocess at startup (`env=` on `Popen`) instead of after via `Object.assign`. `NODE_OPTIONS=--require ./init.js` and similar process-level env vars now work correctly, matching real AWS Lambda behaviour.

## [1.1.19] — 2026-04-02

- Version bump from v1.1.18 — no code changes, re-tag for PyPI publish

---

## [1.1.18] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **EC2 `DescribeInstanceCreditSpecifications`** — returns `standard` CPU credits; fixes Terraform v6 provider compatibility
- **EC2 Terraform v6 stubs** — `DescribeInstanceMaintenanceOptions`, `DescribeInstanceAutoRecoveryAttribute`, `ModifyInstanceMaintenanceOptions`, `DescribeInstanceTopology`, `DescribeSpotInstanceRequests`, `DescribeCapacityReservations` all return sensible empty/default responses
- **Lambda Node.js warm worker pool** — Node.js functions now use the same persistent warm worker as Python; supports async/await, Promise, and callback handlers; AWS SDK v2 endpoint patching for local development
- **Docker image includes Node.js** — `nodejs` added to Alpine base image so container-based Node.js Lambda execution works out of the box in Docker Compose / CI environments
- **Lambda S3 code fetch** — `CreateFunction` and `UpdateFunctionCode` now accept `S3Bucket`/`S3Key` in addition to `ZipFile`; returns error if S3 object not found
- **Lambda versioning** — `Publish=True` on `CreateFunction` and `UpdateFunctionCode` now creates immutable numbered versions with their own `code_zip`
- **DynamoDB Streams** — `StreamSpecification` on `CreateTable` now emits INSERT/MODIFY/REMOVE records on all write operations (`PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`, `BatchWriteItem`, `TransactWriteItems`); respects `StreamViewType`
- **Kinesis ESM polling** — Lambda event source mappings now support Kinesis streams in addition to SQS

### Fixed
- **SNS `Subscribe` ignores `Attributes` parameter** — `RawMessageDelivery`, `FilterPolicy`, `FilterPolicyScope`, `DeliveryPolicy`, and `RedrivePolicy` passed at subscription creation time are now applied immediately
- **Lambda warm worker not invalidated on code update** — `UpdateFunctionCode` and `DeleteFunction` now invalidate the warm worker pool so the next invocation picks up the new code
- **Lambda module-level imports** — removed lazy `from ministack.core.lambda_runtime import` inside functions; moved to module top level
- **S3 chunked transfer encoding** — AWS SDK v2 sends `PutObject` with `STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD` chunked encoding; body was stored with chunk headers causing corrupt `GetObject` responses; now decoded before storage
- **Kinesis validation limits** — `PutRecord` and `PutRecords` now enforce AWS limits: max 1 MB per record, max 500 records per batch, max 5 MB total payload, max 256-char partition key
- **S3 Control routing via `s3-control.localhost` host** — requests with host header `s3-control.localhost` were intercepted by the S3 virtual-hosted bucket handler instead of reaching the S3 Control API; fixes Terraform `ListTagsForResource` returning 404 `NoSuchResource`
- **EC2 security group rule deduplication** — `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress/Egress` no longer appends duplicate rules; fixes Terraform showing constant drift
- **EC2 default egress rule on created security groups** — non-default security groups now include the standard allow-all egress rule matching AWS behaviour
- **EC2 VPC Peering missing Region field** — `requesterVpcInfo` and `accepterVpcInfo` now include `<region>` in all responses; fixes Terraform failing to parse peering connections
- **Lambda `PublishVersion` FunctionArn** — no longer appends version number to FunctionArn (version is in the Version field); fixes Terraform ARN comparison drift
- **Lambda `FunctionUrlConfig` hardcoded region** — now uses `MINISTACK_REGION` instead of hardcoded `us-east-1`
- **Lambda handler validation** — returns proper `Runtime.InvalidEntrypoint` error if handler name has no `.` separator instead of crashing
- **RDS error code** — `DBInstanceAlreadyExists` corrected to `DBInstanceAlreadyExistsFault` matching AWS error codes

### Tests
- 834 tests total, all passing

## [1.1.17] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **EC2 `DescribeInstanceCreditSpecifications`** — returns `standard` CPU credits; fixes Terraform v6 provider compatibility
- **EC2 Terraform v6 stubs** — `DescribeInstanceMaintenanceOptions`, `DescribeInstanceAutoRecoveryAttribute`, `ModifyInstanceMaintenanceOptions`, `DescribeInstanceTopology`, `DescribeSpotInstanceRequests`, `DescribeCapacityReservations` all return sensible empty/default responses to prevent Terraform v6 from failing on unknown actions

### Tests
- 818 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.16] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **`MINISTACK_REGION` environment variable** — all 25 services now read region from `MINISTACK_REGION` (defaulting to `us-east-1`); previously all services hardcoded the region in ARNs and response metadata. Lambda also checks `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` as a secondary fallback. Contributed by @xingzihai and @santiagodoldan

### Tests
- 815 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.15] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Lambda Node.js runtime** — `nodejs14.x` through `nodejs22.x` (and any future `nodejsN.x`) now fully execute via local subprocess (`node`) or Docker; supports `CreateFunction`, `UpdateFunctionCode`, `Invoke` including async handlers; layers resolved to `nodejs/node_modules`; `nodejs24.x` auto-maps via pattern

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation auto-generated physical names** — resources without explicit names now follow the AWS pattern `{stackName}-{logicalId}-{SUFFIX}` with a 13-char uppercase alphanumeric suffix; service-specific rules applied (S3: lowercase, max 63; SQS: max 80; DynamoDB: max 255; Lambda/IAM/EventBridge: max 64). Fixes CDK stacks that omit explicit resource names producing untraceable `cfn-xxx` names
- **Import cleanup** — moved lazy stdlib imports (`base64`, `fnmatch`, `re`, `datetime`, `urllib`) to module level across `sqs`, `cloudwatch_logs`, `glue`, `cognito`, `rds`, `apigateway`, `apigateway_v1`; removed duplicate `os`/`re` imports in `s3`

### Tests
- 3 new Node.js Lambda tests (create+invoke, nodejs22.x, UpdateFunctionCode)
- 4 new CFN physical name tests (S3/SQS/DynamoDB auto-name pattern, explicit name not overridden)
- 815 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.14] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Lambda layer enhancements** — `GetLayerVersionByArn`, `AddLayerVersionPermission`, `RemoveLayerVersionPermission`, `GetLayerVersionPolicy`; layer zip content served via `/_ministack/lambda-layers/{name}/{ver}/content` so runtimes can fetch layers; `ListLayerVersions` and `ListLayers` now support runtime and architecture filtering with pagination. Contributed by @mickabd
- **`MINISTACK_HOST` environment variable** — controls the hostname used in all response URLs (`QueueUrl`, SNS `SubscribeURL`/`UnsubscribeURL`, API Gateway `apiEndpoint`/`domainName`, CFN-provisioned SQS queues, Lambda layer `Content.Location`). Defaults to `localhost`. Set to your Docker Compose service name (e.g. `ministack`) so other containers can reach returned URLs directly. Contributed by @santiagodoldan and @David2011Hernandez

### Fixed
- **EC2 `DescribeInstanceAttribute`** — added support for all standard attributes (`instanceType`, `instanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior`, `disableApiTermination`, `userData`, `rootDeviceName`, `blockDeviceMapping`, `sourceDestCheck`, `groupSet`, `ebsOptimized`, `enaSupport`, `sriovNetSupport`); required by Terraform AWS Provider >= 6.0.0 during state refresh. Contributed by @samiuoi
- **EC2 `DescribeInstanceTypes`** — added handler returning hardware specs (vCPU, memory, network, EBS) for 12 common instance families (t2, t3, m5, c5, r5, p3); required by Terraform AWS Provider >= 6.0.0
- **S3 Control `ListTagsForResource`** — was always returning an empty tag list; now returns tags set via `PutBucketTagging`. Fixes Terraform `aws_s3_bucket` perpetual drift when a `tags` block is configured
- **Lambda layer `Content.Location`** — URL now respects `MINISTACK_HOST` and `GATEWAY_PORT` instead of hardcoded `localhost`

### Changed
- Virtual-hosted S3 and execute-api host-header matching now respects `MINISTACK_HOST`, so `{bucket}.<host>` and `{apiId}.execute-api.<host>` patterns work with any configured hostname

### Tests
- **CloudFormation e2e suite merged** — `test_cfn_e2e.py` merged into `test_services.py`; 10 e2e tests now run within the unified test session
- 19 new tests (EC2, S3 Control, Lambda layer permissions/pagination/filtering/GetByArn/content)
- 808 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.13] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **CloudFormation** — full stack lifecycle: `CreateStack`, `UpdateStack`, `DeleteStack`, `DescribeStacks`, `ListStacks`, `DescribeStackEvents`, `DescribeStackResource`, `DescribeStackResources`, `GetTemplate`, `ValidateTemplate`, `GetTemplateSummary`, `ListExports`; change sets (`CreateChangeSet`, `DescribeChangeSet`, `ExecuteChangeSet`, `DeleteChangeSet`, `ListChangeSets`); JSON and YAML template support including `!Ref`, `!Sub`, `!GetAtt` shorthand; full intrinsic function resolution (`Ref`, `Fn::GetAtt`, `Fn::Join`, `Fn::Sub`, `Fn::Select`, `Fn::Split`, `Fn::If`, `Fn::Base64`, `Fn::FindInMap`, `Fn::ImportValue`, `Fn::GetAZs`, `Fn::Cidr`); conditions (`Fn::Equals`, `Fn::And`, `Fn::Or`, `Fn::Not`); parameters with `AllowedValues`, `Default`, `NoEcho`; rollback on failure with reverse-order cleanup; cross-stack exports via `Fn::ImportValue`; 12 resource types provisioned directly into service state (`AWS::S3::Bucket`, `AWS::SQS::Queue`, `AWS::SNS::Topic`, `AWS::SNS::Subscription`, `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`, `AWS::Lambda::Function`, `AWS::IAM::Role`, `AWS::IAM::Policy`, `AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile`, `AWS::SSM::Parameter`, `AWS::Logs::LogGroup`, `AWS::Events::Rule`). Contributed by @sam-fakhreddine

### Fixed
- **CloudFormation Lambda `ZipFile`** — inline `Code.ZipFile` source is now correctly packaged into a zip archive, making CFN-deployed Lambda functions invokable
- **CloudFormation async task** — replaced deprecated `asyncio.ensure_future()` with `asyncio.get_event_loop().create_task()` in stack deploy, delete, and change set execution
- **README architecture diagram** — fixed box alignment and added CloudFormation to service list. Contributed by @oefrha (HackerNews)

### Tests
- 788 tests total (before v1.1.14 additions)

---

## [1.1.12] — 2026-03-31

### Changed
- Updated LICENSE copyright year to 2026. Contributed by @kay_o (HackerNews)

---

## [1.1.11] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **ACM (Certificate Manager)** — full control plane: `RequestCertificate`, `DescribeCertificate`, `ListCertificates`, `DeleteCertificate`, `GetCertificate`, `ImportCertificate`, `AddTagsToCertificate`, `RemoveTagsFromCertificate`, `ListTagsForCertificate`, `UpdateCertificateOptions`, `RenewCertificate`, `ResendValidationEmail`; certificates issued immediately with status `ISSUED` and DNS validation records; compatible with Terraform `aws_acm_certificate` and CDK `Certificate`
- **SES v2** — REST API at `/v2/email/`: `SendEmail`, `CreateEmailIdentity`, `GetEmailIdentity`, `DeleteEmailIdentity`, `ListEmailIdentities`, `CreateConfigurationSet`, `GetConfigurationSet`, `DeleteConfigurationSet`, `ListConfigurationSets`, `GetAccount`, `ListSuppressedDestinations`, `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, `ListTagsForResource`; identities auto-verified; compatible with Terraform `aws_sesv2_email_identity` and CDK `EmailIdentity`
- **WAF v2** — full control plane: WebACL CRUD, IPSet CRUD, RuleGroup CRUD (including `UpdateRuleGroup`), `AssociateWebACL`/`DisassociateWebACL`, `GetWebACLForResource`, `ListResourcesForWebACL`, `TagResource`/`UntagResource`/`ListTagsForResource`, `CheckCapacity`, `DescribeManagedRuleGroup`; LockToken enforced on Update/Delete; rules stored but not enforced; compatible with Terraform `aws_wafv2_web_acl` and CDK `CfnWebACL`
- **Lambda Layers** — `PublishLayerVersion`, `GetLayerVersion`, `ListLayerVersions`, `ListLayers`, `DeleteLayerVersion`; layer zip content stored in-memory and injected into function execution environment

### Fixed
- **WAF v2 `GetWebACL`/`GetIPSet`/`GetRuleGroup`** — `LockToken` was incorrectly included inside the resource body; now only returned at the top level, matching real AWS and fixing CDK/Terraform Update flows
- **WAF v2 `GetWebACLForResource`** — now returns `WAFNonexistentItemException` when no association exists, matching real AWS behaviour
- **SES v2 `TagResource`/`UntagResource`/`ListTagsForResource`** — added; Terraform calls these after `CreateEmailIdentity`

### Tests
- 763 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.10] — 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **ECS Docker network detection** — ECS containers now automatically join the same Docker network that MiniStack is running on, so containers can reach sibling services (S3, SQS, etc.) without manual network configuration. Contributed by @mickabd
- **Internal naming cleanup** — replaced all internal `localstack-*` references (logger name, default data dir `/tmp/localstack-data/s3` → `/tmp/ministack-data/s3`, healthcheck URLs, CI config) with `ministack` equivalents; `LOCALSTACK_PERSISTENCE` / `LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME` env vars kept for migration compatibility
- **DynamoDB GSI capacity accounting** — `PutItem`, `DeleteItem`, `UpdateItem`, `GetItem`, `Query`, `Scan`, and `BatchWriteItem` now return correct `ConsumedCapacity.CapacityUnits` when a table has Global Secondary Indexes: `1 + gsi_count` per write (matching real AWS); `INDEXES` mode also returns per-GSI breakdown. Contributed by @jespinoza-shippo.
- **S3 `CreateBucket` idempotency** — creating a bucket you already own now returns 200 instead of 409 `BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou`, matching real AWS and fixing Terraform re-apply failures
- **S3 `OwnershipControls`** — `PutBucketOwnershipControls`, `GetBucketOwnershipControls`, `DeleteBucketOwnershipControls` now implemented; Terraform calls these immediately after `CreateBucket`
- **S3 Control `ListTagsForResource`** — S3 Control API (`/v20180820/tags/{arn}`) now returns empty tag list instead of 404; Terraform uses this for S3 bucket tag lookups
- **S3 `PublicAccessBlock`** — `PutPublicAccessBlock`, `GetPublicAccessBlock`, `DeletePublicAccessBlock` now implemented; CDK and Terraform call these on every bucket
- **STS `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`** — now implemented; CDK OIDC deployments (GitHub Actions, etc.) use this; also fixed router to detect unsigned form-encoded STS actions from request body
- **IAM `UpdateRole`** — now implemented; Terraform calls this to set role description and max session duration

### Tests
- 737 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.9] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **S3 Object Lock** — full WORM enforcement on top of versioned buckets
  - `PutObjectLockConfiguration` / `GetObjectLockConfiguration` — enable Object Lock on a bucket with `COMPLIANCE` or `GOVERNANCE` default retention (days or years)
  - `PutObjectRetention` / `GetObjectRetention` — per-object retention with `COMPLIANCE` (always blocks delete) and `GOVERNANCE` (`x-amz-bypass-governance-retention` header bypasses)
  - `PutObjectLegalHold` / `GetObjectLegalHold` — `ON` status unconditionally blocks deletion regardless of retention mode
  - Default retention auto-applied on `PutObject` when bucket lock configuration is present
  @Contributed by @mickabd
- **S3 Replication** — bucket-level replication configuration CRUD
  - `PutBucketReplication` / `GetBucketReplication` / `DeleteBucketReplication`
- **S3 Tagging improvements** — URL-encoded tagging header parsing now correctly handles `x-amz-tagging` on `PutObject` and `CopyObject`

### Tests
- 16 new integration tests covering Object Lock, Replication, and Tagging — 730 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.8] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Cognito TOTP MFA** — full end-to-end Software Token MFA flow now works with CDK and boto3
  - `AssociateSoftwareToken` returns a stub TOTP secret + session (accepts `AccessToken` or `Session`)
  - `VerifySoftwareToken` accepts any code and marks the user as TOTP-enrolled (`_mfa_enabled`, `_preferred_mfa`)
  - `AdminSetUserMFAPreference` — new: enables/disables TOTP or SMS MFA per user and sets preferred method
  - `SetUserMFAPreference` — new: public (AccessToken-based) equivalent of the above
  - `AdminInitiateAuth` / `InitiateAuth` now issue `SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA` challenge after password auth when pool `MfaConfiguration` is `ON` or `OPTIONAL` and user has TOTP enrolled
  - `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` / `RespondToAuthChallenge` accept any TOTP code for `SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA` and return tokens (emulator — no real TOTP validation)
  - `AdminGetUser` / `GetUser` now return real `UserMFASettingList` and `PreferredMfaSetting` fields
  - `MFA_SETUP` challenge handled in both respond endpoints (for pool `ON` + unenrolled users)

### Tests
- 4 new integration tests: full TOTP flow, OPTIONAL MFA, AdminGetUser MFA fields, SetUserMFAPreference via token — 714 tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.7] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Athena engine control** — new `ATHENA_ENGINE` env var (`auto` | `duckdb` | `mock`) to select the SQL backend at startup; `auto` keeps existing behaviour (DuckDB if installed, mock otherwise). New `/_ministack/config` endpoint accepts `POST {"athena.ATHENA_ENGINE": "mock"}` to switch engines at runtime without restart — useful in CI to force mock mode without DuckDB installed.
- **VPC gap coverage** — 6 new EC2 resource types, 22 new actions, 11 new tests
  - **NAT Gateways**: `CreateNatGateway`, `DescribeNatGateways`, `DeleteNatGateway` — supports `SubnetId`, `ConnectivityType` (public/private), state transitions, `vpc-id`/`subnet-id`/`state` filters
  - **Network ACLs**: `CreateNetworkAcl`, `DescribeNetworkAcls`, `DeleteNetworkAcl`, `CreateNetworkAclEntry`, `DeleteNetworkAclEntry`, `ReplaceNetworkAclEntry`, `ReplaceNetworkAclAssociation` — full CRUD with rule entries and subnet associations
  - **Flow Logs**: `CreateFlowLogs`, `DescribeFlowLogs`, `DeleteFlowLogs` — supports VPC/subnet/ENI resource targets, CloudWatch Logs and S3 destinations, `resource-id` filter
  - **VPC Peering**: `CreateVpcPeeringConnection`, `AcceptVpcPeeringConnection`, `DescribeVpcPeeringConnections`, `DeleteVpcPeeringConnection` — full lifecycle from `pending-acceptance` → `active` → `deleted`, cross-account/cross-region params accepted
  - **DHCP Options**: `CreateDhcpOptions`, `AssociateDhcpOptions`, `DescribeDhcpOptions`, `DeleteDhcpOptions` — arbitrary key/value configurations, association updates `VpcId.DhcpOptionsId`
  - **Egress-Only Internet Gateways**: `CreateEgressOnlyInternetGateway`, `DescribeEgressOnlyInternetGateways`, `DeleteEgressOnlyInternetGateway` — IPv6 egress-only IGW for VPCs. Contributed by @mickabd

### Fixed
- **SQS `awsQueryCompatible` header** — all SQS JSON error responses now include the `x-amzn-query-error: <legacy_code>;<fault>` header required by the `awsQueryCompatible` service trait. botocore reads this header and overrides `Error.Code` with the legacy `AWS.SimpleQueueService.*` namespaced code (e.g. `AWS.SimpleQueueService.NonExistentQueue` instead of `QueueDoesNotExist`). Without this header, any SDK code that matched against the legacy string worked against real AWS but silently failed against MiniStack. Full mapping of all 28 SQS error shapes sourced from `aws-sdk-go` ErrCode constants. Contributed by @jespinoza-shippo.

### Tests
- 708 integration tests — all passing

---

## [1.1.6] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **XML error responses** — added `<Type>Sender</Type>` (4xx) / `<Type>Receiver</Type>` (5xx) to all XML error responses in `sqs.py` and `core/responses.py` (used by S3, SNS, IAM, STS, CloudWatch). botocore requires this element to populate typed exception classes (e.g. `client.exceptions.QueueDoesNotExist`). Without it, botocore fell back to generic `ClientError` even when the error `Code` was correct.

### Tests
- 694 integration tests — all passing

---

## [1.1.5] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **API Gateway v1** — `createdDate` / `lastUpdatedDate` fields now returned as Unix timestamps (integers) instead of ISO strings. Terraform AWS provider v4+ deserializes these as JSON Numbers and raised `expected Timestamp to be a JSON Number, got string instead` on `CreateRestApi`.
- **API Gateway v2** — same fix applied to `createdDate` / `lastUpdatedDate` on APIs and stages.
- **S3 virtual-hosted style** — host pattern now also matches `{bucket}.s3.localhost[:{port}]` in addition to `{bucket}.localhost[:{port}]`. Terraform AWS provider v4+ uses the `.s3.` subdomain when `force_path_style = false`.
- **CloudWatch Logs `ListTagsForResource`** — ARN lookup now accepts both `arn:...:log-group:{name}` and `arn:...:log-group:{name}:*`. Terraform passes the ARN without the trailing `:*` that MiniStack appends internally, causing `ResourceNotFoundException`.
- **SQS `SendMessageBatch`** — now rejects batches with more than 10 entries with `AWS.SimpleQueueService.TooManyEntriesInBatchRequest`, matching real AWS behaviour. Previously MiniStack silently accepted oversized batches.
- **DynamoDB `BatchWriteItem`** — now includes `ConsumedCapacity` as a list in the response when `ReturnConsumedCapacity` is set to `TOTAL` or `INDEXES`. Previously the field was absent entirely.

### Tests
- 5 regression tests added (one per fix above) — 693 integration tests total, all passing

---

## [1.1.4] — 2026-03-30

### Added

  - **Tags**: `AddTags`, `RemoveTags`, `DescribeTags`
  - **Data plane — ALB→Lambda live traffic routing**
    - Incoming HTTP requests matched against configured listener rules (priority order)
    - Rule conditions supported: `path-pattern`, `host-header`, `http-method`, `query-string`, `http-header` (fnmatch glob matching)
    - Actions supported: `forward` (to target group), `fixed-response`, `redirect` (301/302 with `#{host}`/`#{path}`/`#{port}` substitution)
    - `TargetType=lambda` target groups: builds ALB event payload (httpMethod, path, queryStringParameters, multiValueQueryStringParameters, headers, multiValueHeaders, body, isBase64Encoded, requestContext.elb) and invokes Lambda via the in-process Lambda runtime; translates Lambda response (statusCode, headers, multiValueHeaders, body, isBase64Encoded) back to HTTP
    - Two addressing modes — no DNS or `/etc/hosts` changes required for local testing:
      - **Host-header**: `Host: {lb-name}.alb.localhost[:{port}]` or the ALB's exact `DNSName`
      - **Path prefix**: `/_alb/{lb-name}/path` (rewrites path before rule evaluation)
  - Query/XML protocol via `Action=` parameter; credential scope `elasticloadbalancing`
  - 10 control-plane integration tests + 7 data-plane integration tests

### Tests
- 688 integration tests — all passing

  - `GetActivityTask` — async long-poll (up to 60 s) returning `taskToken` + `input` to worker; non-blocking (uses `asyncio.sleep` — does not stall the event loop)
  - Activity Task state execution — when a Task state's `Resource` is an activity ARN, the execution enqueues the task and waits for a worker to call `SendTaskSuccess` or `SendTaskFailure`
  - `ActivityAlreadyExists` raised on duplicate `CreateActivity` (matches AWS behaviour — not idempotent)
  - `ActivityDoesNotExist` raised on `DeleteActivity`, `DescribeActivity`, `GetActivityTask` for unknown ARN
  - Activity ARN format: `arn:aws:states:{region}:{account}:activity:{name}`
  - 5 integration tests: CRUD, list, duplicate-name error, worker success flow, worker failure flow

### Tests

- 644 integration tests — all passing

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- **Amazon Cognito** (`ministack/services/cognito.py`) — full User Pool and Identity Pool emulation
  - **User Pools (cognito-idp)**: CreateUserPool, DeleteUserPool, DescribeUserPool, ListUserPools, UpdateUserPool
  - **User Pool Clients**: CreateUserPoolClient, DeleteUserPoolClient, DescribeUserPoolClient, ListUserPoolClients, UpdateUserPoolClient
  - **User management**: AdminCreateUser, AdminDeleteUser, AdminGetUser, ListUsers (with filter support: `=`, `^=`, `!=`), AdminSetUserPassword, AdminUpdateUserAttributes, AdminConfirmSignUp, AdminDisableUser, AdminEnableUser, AdminResetUserPassword, AdminUserGlobalSignOut
  - **Auth flows**: AdminInitiateAuth, AdminRespondToAuthChallenge, InitiateAuth, RespondToAuthChallenge — ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH, ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH, USER_PASSWORD_AUTH, REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH / REFRESH_TOKEN (both accepted), USER_SRP_AUTH (returns PASSWORD_VERIFIER challenge); FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD challenge on first login
  - **Self-service**: SignUp (always UNCONFIRMED — AutoVerifiedAttributes verifies the attribute, not the account), ConfirmSignUp, ForgotPassword, ConfirmForgotPassword, ChangePassword (decodes access token and updates stored password), GetUser, UpdateUserAttributes, DeleteUser, GlobalSignOut, RevokeToken
  - **Groups**: CreateGroup, DeleteGroup, GetGroup, ListGroups, ListUsersInGroup, AdminAddUserToGroup, AdminRemoveUserFromGroup, AdminListGroupsForUser, AdminListUserAuthEvents
  - **Domain**: CreateUserPoolDomain, DeleteUserPoolDomain, DescribeUserPoolDomain
  - **MFA**: GetUserPoolMfaConfig, SetUserPoolMfaConfig, AssociateSoftwareToken, VerifySoftwareToken
  - **Tags**: TagResource, UntagResource, ListTagsForResource
  - **Identity Pools (cognito-identity)**: CreateIdentityPool, DeleteIdentityPool, DescribeIdentityPool, ListIdentityPools, UpdateIdentityPool, GetId, GetCredentialsForIdentity, GetOpenIdToken, SetIdentityPoolRoles, GetIdentityPoolRoles, ListIdentities, DescribeIdentity, MergeDeveloperIdentities, UnlinkDeveloperIdentity, UnlinkIdentity, TagResource, UntagResource, ListTagsForResource
  - **OAuth2**: `POST /oauth2/token` — client_credentials flow; returns stub Bearer token
  - Stub JWT tokens: structurally valid base64url JWTs (non-cryptographic); IDP pool ARN format `arn:aws:cognito-idp:region:account:userpool/{id}`; Identity pool ID format `region:{uuid}`
  - `_user_from_token` shared helper — decodes stub JWT payload to find user by `sub`, used by GetUser, UpdateUserAttributes, DeleteUser, ChangePassword, and REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH
  - Wired into router, SERVICE_HANDLERS, SERVICE_NAME_ALIASES, `_reset_all_state()`, and both credential scopes (`cognito-idp`, `cognito-identity`)
  - 43 integration tests covering full CRUD lifecycle for User Pools, Pool Clients, Users, Auth flows, Refresh tokens, Groups, Domains, MFA, Tags, and Identity Pools

### Changed

- **Package restructure**: all source code moved into `ministack/` package (`ministack/app.py`, `ministack/core/`, `ministack/services/`) — fixes `pip install ministack` entrypoint crash (`app:main` was unresolvable because `app.py` was not included in the wheel)
- **Entrypoint**: `ministack = "app:main"` → `ministack = "ministack.app:main"`
- **ASGI module**: `app:app` → `ministack.app:app` in Dockerfile and CI
- **PyPI trusted publishing**: OIDC workflow added (`pypi-publish.yml`) — no API token needed, publishes on `v*.*.*` tag push

### Fixed

- **Lambda `GetFunctionConcurrency`**: returns `{}` instead of 404 after `DeleteFunctionConcurrency` — matches AWS behaviour where an unset concurrency limit returns an empty response
- **Cognito `GetCredentialsForIdentity`**: response field is `SecretKey` (correct boto3 wire name) — was incorrectly named `SecretAccessKey`
- **ElastiCache `ModifyCacheParameterGroup` / `ResetCacheParameterGroup`**: parameter list key was `ParameterNameValues.member.{n}.*` — corrected to `ParameterNameValues.ParameterNameValue.{n}.*` matching actual boto3 Query API serialisation
- **RDS / ElastiCache / ECS `reset()`**: `container.remove()` → `container.remove(v=True)` — Docker volumes created by stopped containers are now removed along with the container, preventing anonymous volume accumulation across test runs
- **RDS `containers.run()`**: added `tmpfs` mount for `/var/lib/postgresql/data` and `/var/lib/mysql` — postgres/mysql data lives in container RAM; no anonymous Docker volumes created per instance
- **Docker Compose**: added `build: .` so `docker compose up --build` uses local source instead of always pulling from Docker Hub

### Infrastructure

- **`Makefile` `purge` target**: kills all containers labelled `ministack`, prunes dangling volumes, and clears `./data/s3/` — safe to run alongside other projects (filter is label-scoped, not image-scoped)

### Tests

- 3 package structure tests: `test_package_core_importable`, `test_package_services_importable`, `test_app_asgi_callable`
- Merged all 97 tests from `test_qa_comprehensive.py` into `test_services.py` — single test file, `test_qa_comprehensive.py` deleted
- Fixed `test_cognito_get_id_and_credentials`: `SecretAccessKey` → `SecretKey`
- Fixed `test_apigwv1_usage_plan_key_crud`: `Name`/`Enabled` → `name`/`enabled` (boto3 lowercase params)
- Fixed `test_lambda_reset_terminates_workers`: timeout 5 s → 15 s with 3-attempt retry
- Fixed `test_rds_snapshot_crud` / `test_rds_deletion_protection`: added `finally` cleanup so RDS containers are deleted after each test
- 613 integration tests — all passing against Docker image (618 as of v1.1.1)

---

## [1.0.8] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- **Amazon Route53** (`services/route53.py`) — full hosted zone and DNS record management
  - Hosted zones: `CreateHostedZone`, `GetHostedZone`, `DeleteHostedZone`, `ListHostedZones`, `ListHostedZonesByName`, `UpdateHostedZoneComment`
  - Record sets: `ChangeResourceRecordSets` (CREATE / UPSERT / DELETE, atomic batch), `ListResourceRecordSets`
  - Changes: `GetChange` — changes are immediately `INSYNC`
  - Health checks: `CreateHealthCheck`, `GetHealthCheck`, `DeleteHealthCheck`, `ListHealthChecks`, `UpdateHealthCheck`
  - Tags: `ChangeTagsForResource`, `ListTagsForResource` (hostedzone and healthcheck resource types)
  - REST/XML protocol with namespace `https://route53.amazonaws.com/doc/2013-04-01/`; credential scope `route53`
  - SOA + NS records auto-created on zone creation with 4 default AWS nameservers
  - `CallerReference` idempotency for `CreateHostedZone` and `CreateHealthCheck`
  - Alias records (AliasTarget), weighted, failover, latency, geolocation, multi-value routing attributes stored and returned
  - Zone ID format `/hostedzone/Z{13chars}`, Change ID `/change/C{13chars}`
  - Marker-based pagination for `ListHostedZones` and `ListHealthChecks`; name/type pagination for `ListResourceRecordSets`
  - 16 integration tests
- **Non-ASCII / Unicode support** — seamless end-to-end handling of UTF-8 content across all services
  - Inbound header values decoded as UTF-8 (with latin-1 fallback) so `x-amz-meta-*` fields containing non-ASCII are stored correctly
  - Outbound header encoding falls back to UTF-8 when a value cannot be encoded as latin-1 — prevents `UnicodeEncodeError` on `Content-Disposition` or metadata round-trips
  - All JSON responses use `ensure_ascii=False` — raw UTF-8 characters in DynamoDB items, SQS messages, Secrets Manager values, SSM parameters, and Lambda payloads are returned as-is rather than `\uXXXX` escaped
  - 7 integration tests covering S3 keys, S3 metadata, DynamoDB, SQS, Secrets Manager, SSM, and Route53 zone comments

### Fixed

- **DynamoDB TTL reaper thread-safety**: the background reaper thread now holds `_lock` while scanning and deleting expired items — eliminates a race condition with concurrent request handlers that could corrupt table state or crash the reaper under load
- **S3 `PutObject` / `CreateBucket` spurious `Content-Type`**: these operations no longer return `Content-Type: application/xml` on success (AWS returns no Content-Type for empty 200 bodies) — prevents SDK response-parsing warnings
- **S3 `DeleteObject` delete-marker header**: non-versioned buckets now return an empty 204 with no extra headers; versioned/suspended buckets return `x-amz-delete-marker: true` — previously all buckets unconditionally returned `x-amz-delete-marker: false`
- **CloudWatch Logs `FilterLogEvents` pattern matching**: upgraded from plain substring search to proper CloudWatch filter syntax — supports `*`/`?` glob wildcards, multi-term AND (`TERM1 TERM2`), term exclusion (`-TERM`), and JSON-style patterns (matched as pass-all); previously only exact substring matches worked
- **JSON responses `ensure_ascii`**: all JSON service responses now use `ensure_ascii=False` so non-ASCII strings (Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic, etc.) are returned as raw UTF-8 rather than `\uXXXX` escape sequences — matches real AWS behaviour
- **Inbound header UTF-8 decoding**: request header values are now decoded as UTF-8 with latin-1 fallback — `x-amz-meta-*` headers containing multi-byte characters are stored and round-tripped correctly
- **Outbound header UTF-8 encoding**: response headers that cannot be encoded as latin-1 (e.g. metadata containing non-ASCII) now fall back to UTF-8 encoding instead of raising `UnicodeEncodeError`
- **API Gateway v2 / v1 Lambda response encoding**: Lambda invocation response bodies serialised via `json.dumps` now use `ensure_ascii=False` and explicit `utf-8` encoding — non-ASCII characters in Lambda responses are preserved end-to-end
- **DynamoDB `Query` pagination on hash-only tables**: `_apply_exclusive_start_key` was returning `[]` for any table without a sort key (`sk_name=None`) because `not sk_name` short-circuited to an empty-result path — hash-only tables now paginate correctly by resuming after the matching partition key value (validated against botocore `dynamodb` service model)
- **SQS `DeleteMessageBatch` silent success on invalid receipt handle**: both the found and not-found branches were appending to `Successful` (copy-paste error) — an unmatched `ReceiptHandle` now correctly populates the `Failed` list with `ReceiptHandleIsInvalid` (validated against botocore `BatchResultErrorEntry` shape)
- **SNS→Lambda `EventSubscriptionArn` hardcoded suffix**: the SNS-to-Lambda fanout envelope was setting `EventSubscriptionArn` to `"{topic_arn}:subscription"` instead of the actual subscription ARN — Lambda functions inspecting `event['Records'][0]['EventSubscriptionArn']` now receive the correct value
- **Lambda error codes**: internal path-routing fallbacks now use `InvalidParameterValueException` (400) for missing function name and `ResourceNotFoundException` (404) for unrecognised paths — previously both used the non-existent `InvalidRequest` code which is absent from the botocore Lambda model

- **Lambda worker reset**: `core/lambda_runtime.reset()` was calling `worker.proc.terminate()` (typo) instead of `worker._proc.terminate()` — the `AttributeError` was silently swallowed, leaving orphaned worker subprocesses after `/_ministack/reset`
- **Step Functions → Lambda async invocation**: `stepfunctions._call_lambda` was calling `lambda_svc._invoke` synchronously — `_invoke` is `async`, so it returned a coroutine object instead of executing; Task states invoking Lambda now use `asyncio.run()` to execute the coroutine from the background thread
- **EventBridge → Lambda async invocation**: same bug in `eventbridge._dispatch_to_lambda` — fixed with `asyncio.run()`
- **`make run` Docker socket mount**: added `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` so ECS `RunTask` works when running via `make run`

### Tests

- 4 regression tests added, one per botocore-confirmed bug: `test_ddb_query_pagination_hash_only`, `test_sqs_batch_delete_invalid_receipt_handle`, `test_sns_to_lambda_event_subscription_arn`, `test_lambda_unknown_path_returns_404`
- 2 regression tests for runtime fixes: `test_lambda_reset_terminates_workers`, `test_sfn_integration_lambda_invoke`
- 479 integration tests — all passing, including against Docker image

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-03-27

### Added

- **Amazon Data Firehose** (`services/firehose.py`) — full control and data plane
  - `CreateDeliveryStream`, `DeleteDeliveryStream`, `DescribeDeliveryStream`, `ListDeliveryStreams`
  - `PutRecord`, `PutRecordBatch` — base64-encoded record ingestion; S3-destination streams write records synchronously to the local S3 emulator
  - `UpdateDestination` — concurrency-safe via `CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId` / `VersionId`
  - `TagDeliveryStream`, `UntagDeliveryStream`, `ListTagsForDeliveryStream`
  - `StartDeliveryStreamEncryption`, `StopDeliveryStreamEncryption`
  - Destination types: `ExtendedS3`, `S3` (deprecated alias), `HttpEndpoint`, `Redshift`, `OpenSearch`, `Splunk`, `Snowflake`, `Iceberg`
  - Credential scope: `kinesis-firehose`; target prefix: `Firehose_20150804`
  - AWS-compliant `DescribeDeliveryStream` response: `EncryptionConfiguration` always present in `ExtendedS3DestinationDescription` (default `NoEncryption`); `DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfiguration` only included when encryption is configured; `Source` block populated for `KinesisStreamAsSource` streams
  - `UpdateDestination` merges fields when destination type is unchanged; replaces fully on type change — matching AWS behaviour
  - 16 integration tests, all passing
- **Virtual-hosted style S3**: `{bucket}.localhost[:{port}]` host header routing — requests are rewritten to path-style and forwarded to the S3 handler; compatible with AWS SDK virtual-hosted endpoint configuration

### Fixed

- **DynamoDB expression evaluator short-circuit bug**: `OR`/`AND` operators in `ConditionExpression` and `FilterExpression` now always consume both operands' tokens before applying the logical result — Python's boolean short-circuit was skipping right-hand token consumption when the left operand was already truthy/falsy, causing `Invalid expression: Expected RPAREN, got NAME_REF` on expressions like `attribute_not_exists(#0) OR #1 <= :0` (reported by PynamoDB users with numeric `ExpressionAttributeNames` keys)

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-03-27

### Added

- **API Gateway REST API v1** (`services/apigateway_v1.py`) — complete control plane and data plane
  - Full resource tree: `CreateRestApi`, `GetRestApi`, `GetRestApis`, `UpdateRestApi`, `DeleteRestApi`
  - Resources: `CreateResource`, `GetResource`, `GetResources`, `UpdateResource`, `DeleteResource`
  - Methods: `PutMethod`, `GetMethod`, `DeleteMethod`, `UpdateMethod`
  - Method responses: `PutMethodResponse`, `GetMethodResponse`, `DeleteMethodResponse`
  - Integrations: `PutIntegration`, `GetIntegration`, `DeleteIntegration`, `UpdateIntegration`
  - Integration responses: `PutIntegrationResponse`, `GetIntegrationResponse`, `DeleteIntegrationResponse`
  - Stages: `CreateStage`, `GetStage`, `GetStages`, `UpdateStage`, `DeleteStage`
  - Deployments: `CreateDeployment`, `GetDeployment`, `GetDeployments`, `UpdateDeployment`, `DeleteDeployment`
  - Authorizers: `CreateAuthorizer`, `GetAuthorizer`, `GetAuthorizers`, `UpdateAuthorizer`, `DeleteAuthorizer`
  - Models: `CreateModel`, `GetModel`, `GetModels`, `DeleteModel`
  - API keys: `CreateApiKey`, `GetApiKey`, `GetApiKeys`, `UpdateApiKey`, `DeleteApiKey`
  - Usage plans: `CreateUsagePlan`, `GetUsagePlan`, `GetUsagePlans`, `UpdateUsagePlan`, `DeleteUsagePlan`, `CreateUsagePlanKey`, `GetUsagePlanKeys`, `DeleteUsagePlanKey`
  - Domain names: `CreateDomainName`, `GetDomainName`, `GetDomainNames`, `DeleteDomainName`
  - Base path mappings: `CreateBasePathMapping`, `GetBasePathMapping`, `GetBasePathMappings`, `DeleteBasePathMapping`
  - Tags: `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, `GetTags`
  - Data plane: execute-api requests routed by host header (`{apiId}.execute-api.localhost`)
  - Lambda proxy format 1.0 (AWS_PROXY) — full `requestContext` with `requestTime`, `requestTimeEpoch`, `path`, `protocol`, `multiValueHeaders`; supports both apigateway URI form and plain `arn:aws:lambda:` ARN
  - HTTP proxy (HTTP_PROXY) forwarding to arbitrary HTTP backends
  - MOCK integration — selects response by `selectionPattern`, applies `responseParameters` to HTTP response headers, returns `responseTemplates` body
  - Resource tree path matching with `{param}` placeholders and `{proxy+}` greedy segments
  - JSON Patch support for all `PATCH` operations (`patchOperations`)
  - `CreateDeployment` populates `apiSummary` from all configured resources and methods
  - All timestamps (`createdDate`, `lastUpdatedDate`) returned as ISO 8601 strings — boto3 parses them as `datetime` objects
  - Error responses use `type` field matching AWS API Gateway v1 format
  - State persistence via `get_state()` / `load_persisted_state()`
  - v1 and v2 APIs coexist on the same port without conflict
- 434 integration tests — all passing, including against Docker image

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **DynamoDB `UpdateItem` condition expression on missing item**: `ConditionExpression` such as `attribute_exists(...)` now correctly evaluates against the existing stored item (or empty if missing) — was incorrectly evaluating against the in-progress mutation, causing `ConditionalCheckFailedException` to never fire on missing items
- **DynamoDB key schema validation**: `GetItem`, `DeleteItem`, `UpdateItem`, `BatchWriteItem`, `BatchGetItem` now validate that supplied key attributes match the table schema in name and type — returns `ValidationException: The provided key element does not match the schema`
- **ESM visibility timeout**: SQS → Lambda event source mapping now respects the queue's configured `VisibilityTimeout` instead of hardcoding 30 s — prevents retry storms and duplicate deliveries when Lambda fails
- **Lambda stdout/stderr separation**: handler logs now go to stderr, response payload to stdout — matches AWS Lambda runtime contract; fixes log pollution in response payloads
- **Lambda timeout error**: `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` path now captures and returns stdout/stderr in the error log instead of returning an empty string
- **ECS `_maybe_mark_stopped` container status**: calls `container.reload()` before checking status to get live state from Docker — was reading stale cached status
- **ECS `stoppedAt`/`stoppingAt` timestamps**: now stored as ISO 8601 strings matching AWS ECS API format — was storing Unix epoch float
- **ECS cluster task count**: `_recount_cluster()` now recomputes running/pending counts from all tasks instead of decrementing — prevents count drift on concurrent task terminations
- **Step Functions service integrations**: Task state now dispatches to real MiniStack services via `arn:aws:states:::` resource URIs — `sqs:sendMessage`, `sns:publish`, `dynamodb:putItem`, `dynamodb:getItem`, `dynamodb:deleteItem`, `dynamodb:updateItem`, `ecs:runTask`, `ecs:runTask.sync` — was returning input passthrough instead of invoking the service
- 392 integration tests — all passing, including against Docker image

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **SQS queue URL host/port**: `QueueUrl` values now read `MINISTACK_HOST` and `GATEWAY_PORT` env vars instead of hardcoding `localhost:4566` — fixes queue URLs when running behind a custom hostname or port
- 379 integration tests — all passing, including against Docker image

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- **Test port portability**: execute-api test URLs now read port from `MINISTACK_ENDPOINT` env var instead of hardcoding 4566 — fixes all execute-api tests when running against Docker on a non-default port
- **API Gateway Authorizers**: `CreateAuthorizer`, `GetAuthorizer`, `GetAuthorizers`, `UpdateAuthorizer`, `DeleteAuthorizer` — full CRUD for JWT and Lambda authorizers; state included in persistence snapshot
- **API Gateway `{proxy+}` greedy path matching**: `_path_matches` now handles `{param+}` placeholders matching multiple path segments (e.g. `/files/{proxy+}` matches `/files/a/b/c`)
- **API Gateway `routeKey` in Lambda event**: Lambda proxy event `routeKey` now reflects the matched route key (e.g. `"GET /ping"`) instead of always being `"$default"`
- **API Gateway Authorizer `identitySource` compliance**: field now stored and returned as array of strings (`["$request.header.Authorization"]`) matching AWS spec — was incorrectly a single string
- **Lambda `DeleteFunctionUrlConfig` response**: now returns 204 with empty body (was returning 204 with `{}` body, causing `RemoteDisconnected` in boto3)
- 377 integration tests — all passing, including against Docker image

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-03-25

### Added

**API Gateway HTTP API v2** (completing roadmap item)

- Full control plane: CreateApi, GetApi, GetApis, UpdateApi, DeleteApi
- Routes: CreateRoute, GetRoute, GetRoutes, UpdateRoute, DeleteRoute
- Integrations: CreateIntegration, GetIntegration, GetIntegrations, UpdateIntegration, DeleteIntegration
- Stages: CreateStage, GetStage, GetStages, UpdateStage, DeleteStage
- Deployments: CreateDeployment, GetDeployment, GetDeployments, DeleteDeployment
- Tags: TagResource, UntagResource, GetTags
- Data plane: execute-api requests routed by host header (`{apiId}.execute-api.localhost`)
- Lambda proxy (AWS_PROXY) invocation via API Gateway v2 payload format 2.0
- HTTP proxy (HTTP_PROXY) forwarding to arbitrary HTTP backends
- Route path parameter matching (`{param}` placeholders in route keys)
- State persistence support via `get_state()` / `load_persisted_state()`

**SNS → SQS Fanout** (completing roadmap item)

- SNS subscriptions with `sqs` protocol deliver messages directly to SQS queues
- Message envelope follows AWS SNS JSON notification format
- Fanout is synchronous within the same process

**SQS → Lambda Event Source Mapping**

- `CreateEventSourceMapping` / `DeleteEventSourceMapping` / `GetEventSourceMapping` / `ListEventSourceMappings` / `UpdateEventSourceMapping`
- Background poller delivers SQS messages to Lambda functions as batched events
- Configurable batch size and enabled/disabled state

**Lambda Warm/Cold Start Worker Pool** (`core/lambda_runtime.py`)

- Persistent Python subprocess per function — handler module imported once (cold start)
- Subsequent invocations reuse the warm worker without re-importing
- Worker respawns automatically on crash
- Accurately models AWS Lambda cold/warm start behavior

**State Persistence Infrastructure** (`core/persistence.py`)

- `PERSIST_STATE=1` environment variable enables persistence
- `STATE_DIR` environment variable controls storage location (default `/tmp/ministack-state`)
- Atomic file writes (write-to-tmp then rename) prevent corruption on crash
- API Gateway state persisted across container restarts
- Persistence framework ready for other services to adopt

### Fixed

- `_path_matches` bug in API Gateway: `re.escape` was applied before `{param}` substitution,
  causing all parameterised routes to never match. Fixed by splitting on `{param}` segments,
  escaping literal parts, then joining with `[^/]+` wildcards.
- `execute-api` credential scope in `core/router.py` incorrectly mapped to `lambda`;
  corrected to `apigateway`.

### Infrastructure

- `app.py`: API Gateway registered in `SERVICE_HANDLERS`, BANNER, and `SERVICE_NAME_ALIASES`
- `app.py`: Execute-api data plane dispatched before normal service routing via host-header match
- `app.py`: Persistence load/save wired into ASGI lifespan startup/shutdown
- `core/router.py`: API Gateway patterns added; `/v2/apis` path detection added
- `tests/conftest.py`: `apigw` fixture added (`apigatewayv2` boto3 client)
- `tests/test_services.py`: fixed 4 tests that used hardcoded resource names and collided on repeated runs (`test_kinesis_stream_encryption`, `test_kinesis_enhanced_monitoring`, `test_sfn_start_sync_execution`, `test_sfn_describe_state_machine_for_execution`)
- `tests/test_services.py`: added 10 new tests covering previously untested paths — health endpoint, STS `GetSessionToken`, DynamoDB TTL enable/disable, Lambda warm start, API Gateway execute-api Lambda proxy, `$default` catch-all route, path parameter matching, 404 on missing route, EventBridge → Lambda target dispatch
- `tests/test_services.py`: added 25 new tests covering all new operations introduced since v0.1.0 — Kinesis `SplitShard`/`MergeShards`/`UpdateShardCount`/`RegisterStreamConsumer`/`DeregisterStreamConsumer`/`ListStreamConsumers`, SSM `LabelParameterVersion`/`AddTagsToResource`/`RemoveTagsFromResource`, CloudWatch Logs retention policy/subscription filters/metric filters/tag APIs/Insights, CloudWatch composite alarms/`DescribeAlarmsForMetric`/`DescribeAlarmHistory`, EventBridge archives/permissions, DynamoDB `UpdateTable`, S3 bucket versioning/encryption/lifecycle/CORS/ACL, Athena `UpdateWorkGroup`/`BatchGetNamedQuery`/`BatchGetQueryExecution`
- `README.md`: updated supported operations tables to reflect all new operations across all 21 services
- 371 integration tests — all passing (up from 54 in v0.1.0)

### Fixed (post-release patches)

- **SNS → Lambda fanout**: `protocol == "lambda"` subscriptions now invoke the Lambda function via `_execute_function()` with a standard `Records[].Sns` event envelope (was a no-op stub)
- **DynamoDB TTL enforcement**: background daemon thread (`dynamodb-ttl-reaper`) now scans every 60 s and deletes items whose TTL attribute value is ≤ current epoch time
- **Lambda Function URLs**: `CreateFunctionUrlConfig`, `GetFunctionUrlConfig`, `UpdateFunctionUrlConfig`, `DeleteFunctionUrlConfig`, `ListFunctionUrlConfigs` — full CRUD, persisted in `_function_urls` dict; was a 404 stub
- **`/_ministack/reset` disk cleanup**: when `PERSIST_STATE=1`, reset now also deletes `STATE_DIR/*.json` and `S3_DATA_DIR` contents so a subsequent restart does not reload old state
- **API Gateway `{proxy+}` greedy path matching**: `_path_matches` now handles `{param+}` placeholders matching multiple path segments (e.g. `/files/{proxy+}` matches `/files/a/b/c`)
- **API Gateway `routeKey` in Lambda event**: Lambda proxy event `routeKey` now reflects the matched route key (e.g. `"GET /ping"`) instead of always being `"$default"`
- **API Gateway Authorizers**: `CreateAuthorizer`, `GetAuthorizer`, `GetAuthorizers`, `UpdateAuthorizer`, `DeleteAuthorizer` — full CRUD for JWT and Lambda authorizers; state included in persistence snapshot
- **Test idempotency**: added `POST /_ministack/reset` endpoint and session-scoped `autouse` fixture so the test suite passes on repeated runs against the same server without restarting
- **API Gateway Authorizer `identitySource` compliance**: field now stored and returned as array of strings (`["$request.header.Authorization"]`) matching AWS spec — was incorrectly a single string
- **Lambda `DeleteFunctionUrlConfig` response**: now returns 204 with empty body (was returning 204 with `{}` body, causing `RemoteDisconnected` in boto3)
- **Test port portability**: execute-api test URLs now read port from `MINISTACK_ENDPOINT` env var instead of hardcoding 4566 — fixes all execute-api tests when running against Docker on a non-default port
- 377 integration tests — all passing, including against Docker image

### Roadmap Update

The following roadmap items from v0.1.0 are now **completed**:

- API Gateway (HTTP API v2) — full control and data plane delivered
- SNS → SQS fan-out delivery
- DynamoDB transactions (TransactWriteItems, TransactGetItems)
- S3 multipart upload
- SQS FIFO queues
- Step Functions ASL interpreter (Pass, Task, Choice, Wait, Succeed, Fail, Parallel, Map; Retry/Catch; waitForTaskToken)
